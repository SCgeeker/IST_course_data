[MUSIC]

2
00:00:08.818 --> 00:00:12.700
One of the three approaches drawn
inferences from your data was the path of

3
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.355
Action, the Limon Pearson approach.

4
00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:19.395
In the Nymen Pearson approach, the main
thing is trying to control the errors

5
00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:21.315
when you draw inferences from your data.

6
00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:23.985
When you say yes,
I accept the null hypothesis or

7
00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:26.315
I will reject the null hypothesis,

8
00:00:26.315 --> 00:00:29.915
controlling the amount of times in
the long run that you make a mistake.

9
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.270
Now we talk about this in
terms of the Type 1 and

10
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.330
the Type 2 Errors that you can make.

11
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.340
In the goal of error control,
what you try to do is prevent

12
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.470
making a fool out of yourself,
too often, in the long run and

13
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.570
I think this is a very useful thing to try
when you draw inferences from your data.

14
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.839
Now let's take a look at an example.

15
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.100
Let's say you're walking down the street
and you come across this person.

16
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.220
And you have some suspicions that
this person might be a vampire, but

17
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.090
it could also be someone who's
not getting enough sunlight.

18
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.250
You have to make a decision to either
stake or not stake this individual.

19
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.760
And this person can be a true vampire or

20
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.420
it can just be a random
person on the street.

21
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.950
So we see that there's
a possibility that you

22
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.450
correctly identify this person
as a vampire and stake them.

23
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.430
But you can also make an error.

24
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.080
You can make two types of error.

25
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.220
Type one error is, well this is a vampire
when actually it's not a vampire.

26
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.040
And in this case you would
stake an innocent person.

27
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.750
The second type of error that you
can make, the type two error is

28
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.790
saying that this is probably not
a vampire when it actually is a vampire.

29
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.630
And in this case,
you probably going to end up dead,

30
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.340
because this vampire is going to
suck all the blood out of you.

31
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.520
Let's take a look at some definitions
when we're talking about this topic.

32
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.550
So first,
we have to define the null hypothesis and

33
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.010
the alternative hypothesis,
which we'll often indicate with H0 and H1.

34
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.730
It's important to keep in

35
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.420
mind that the null hypothesis doesn't
necessarily need to be the prediction that

36
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.940
the difference between certain
conditions is exactly zero.

37
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.090
Think about flipping a coin, in which
case the null hypothesis is probably that

38
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.120
there's a 50% probability of
flipping heads and tails.

39
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.980
So the null hypothesis can be anything.

40
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.900
But very often,

41
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.180
it's the idea that there's no difference
between two experimental conditions.

42
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.170
The alpha that we use as
the probability of a significant result

43
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.650
when the null hypothesis is true.

44
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.070
And this is the definition
of a type 1 error rate.

45
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.940
And you're free to set this alpha
at any level that you want.

46
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.263
A very often used level in psychology is
5% but we already saw that in some fields

47
00:02:36.263 --> 00:02:41.289
like physics it's very common to set
in much much lower type one error rate.

48
00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:45.175
And you can also think about areas such as
medicine where it might be useful to set

49
00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:46.750
a much lower error rate as well.

50
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.570
The beta is the probability
of a non-significant result,

51
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.590
given that the alternative
hypothesis is true.

52
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.870
This is known as a type 2 error.

53
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.230
So this is the probability that you'll
say, there is nothing going on here.

54
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.300
When there's actually two
effects to be observed.

55
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.030
If we look at the difference of 1-B,
this is

56
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.790
the probability of the significant result
when the alternative hypothesis is true.

57
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.840
So this is the statistical power.

58
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.730
When you design a study, one minus
the type two error rate is the probability

59
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.090
that you'll actually find the result
if there is a true effect to be found.

60
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.510
Now remember that Naiman thinks that these
error rates are frequentist concepts,

61
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.990
so they apply to the long run.

62
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.020
Now in any single study there's
either a true effect or not.

63
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.180
You were right or you were wrong.

64
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.060
But these error rates are about
long-run frequencies.

65
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.810
So you can be 5% of the time,
you can make a mistake.

66
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.460
But in any single study,
you've either made a mistake or not.

67
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.370
It's important to think
about this in the long run.

68
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.140
So if you do many, many studies, how often
will you make an incorrect conclusion?

69
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.910
Because we have these two situations
where the null hypothesis is true or

70
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.520
the alternative hypothesis is true,

71
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.340
and you can either observe a significant
effect or you will find a non-significant

72
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.320
result, we can divide these
options into these four cells.

73
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.930
And here we can see that when
the null hypothesis is true and

74
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.230
you find a significant effect,
you've made a false positive.

75
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.600
A type I error.

76
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.030
You said there is something here
when there are actually nothing.

77
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.120
When the null hypothesis true you can also
correctly say that there is no true effect

78
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.190
which we called a true negative.

79
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.180
Now in the alternative hypothesis is true.

80
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.750
You find this significance effect,
that's a true positive.

81
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.050
Something is going on and
you correctly identified it.

82
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.900
You can also draw the conclusion
that there is nothing going on,

83
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.660
when there is actually a true effect.

84
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.090
And we call this a false negative.

85
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.010
Now remember that in any single case
you're either sampling from a true effect

86
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.300
or from a false effect.

87
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.110
So you're in one of two parallel worlds.

88
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.420
Either there is no true effect And
then you can only make false positives or

89
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.850
true negatives.

90
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.250
Or you're doing research where there is
actually a true effect and then you can

91
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.380
only make a correct conclusion
a true positive or a false negative.

92
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.330
Now let's take this understanding of
type one errors and type two errors and

93
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.170
true positives and

94
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.239
true negatives to think about what's most
likely to happen in your next study.

95
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.610
I'll describe a typical situation
which I think is fair and

96
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.530
describes many of the studies that we do.

97
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.850
Let say, that you don't really know
if there's a true effect or not.

98
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.620
The null hypothesis might be true, the
alternative hypothesis might be true and

99
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.810
both are equally likely.

100
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.129
Let's give them both 50%, we just
don't know what's going to happened.

101
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.330
We also use a type one error rate,

102
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.310
the alpha of 5% which is very
typical in most research.

103
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.610
And we'll aim for
statistical power of 80%.

104
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.010
Which means that there is
a type two error rate of 20%.

105
00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.840
If there is a true effect,
we will not observe it in 20% on the time.

106
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.110
That's sounds like a lot maybe, but

107
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.860
this is actually a very
recommended power to aim for.

108
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.140
So in this specific situation,

109
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.830
let's assume that this
reflects what you want to do.

110
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.240
You use this type 1 error rate.

111
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.780
And you actually exactly
meet this statistical power.

112
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.990
You have 80% power in your next study.

113
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.590
You never really know but
let's assume that this is the case.

114
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.690
Think a moment what's
the most likely to happen.

115
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.000
Will you find a significant result or
a non-significant result?

116
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.160
Make a false positive or a false negative?

117
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.200
And let's do the math and
see what really happens.

118
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:42.790
So as we said, there's a 50% probability
that a no-hypothesis is true and

119
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.740
a 50% probability that
the alternative hypothesis is true.

120
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.650
Remember, we just didn't know
what was going to happen.

121
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.600
We have a 5% type 1 error rate and
a 20% type 2 error rate.

122
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.660
So, we can use these numbers to
calculate the probability of

123
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.530
each of these four cells to happen, and
of course, they should add up to 100%.

124
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.700
Let's first assume that
the alternative hypothesis is true,

125
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.670
we're examining a true effect.

126
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.300
The probability of finding a significant
effect equals the statistical power that

127
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:18.220
we have, which is 80% and its 50% probable
that the alternative hypothesis is true.

128
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.744
So we can multiply 80% by 50% and

129
00:07:20.744 --> 00:07:25.700
we find that it's 40% likely that we
conclude that there's a true effect.

130
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.370
A true positive.

131
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.430
It's also possible that we find
a non significant effect this will

132
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.820
happen 20% of the time.

133
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.310
Multiplying 20% with the 50% probability
of the alternative hypothesis being true

134
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.380
gives us a 10% probability
of making a false negative.

135
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.420
Now let's move over to the situation
where the null hypothesis is true.

136
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.880
Here we have a 5% error rate.

137
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:53.730
We can multiply this 5% times the 50%
probability of the no hypothesis

138
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.730
is true and in 2.5% of the time we'll
conclude that there's a false positive.

139
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.540
We'll say that there is an effect when
there's actually no effect to be found.

140
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.658
And now we come to the most likely outcome
in this very typical situation, a true.

141
00:08:05.658 --> 00:08:12.140
There's a 95% probability that will
conclude that nothing is going on.

142
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:16.580
Multiply it by the 50%
probability that the null

143
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.850
hypothesis is true which gives us 47.5%.

144
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.550
So that's the highest number of
these four possible outcomes.

145
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.710
And this might be surprising
if you do a new study and

146
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.400
you don't know whether the null is true or
the alternative is true,

147
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.410
you use the recommended alpha level and
the recommended statistical power.

148
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.450
Then the most likely outcome of
your next study is a true negative.

149
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.700
Nothing is going on and you correctly
conclude that nothing is going on.

150
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.200
So you might be surprised that the most
likely outcome is a true negative, and

151
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.550
very often, your interested in
finding significant effect and

152
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.440
finding support for
the alternative hypothesis.

153
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.330
Saying, there is a true effect and

154
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.780
correctly concluding that
there is a true effect.

155
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.800
So how can you improve these
probabilities in the previous slides?

156
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.020
Well there are different options.

157
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.580
Let's take a look at what works best.

158
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.640
You might say, the problem here is
probably that I only had 80% power.

159
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.190
When there is a true effect,
I only had an 80% probability

160
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.830
of finding the effect when it's there, and
I need to increase my statistical power.

161
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.730
Now in this slide you can
see the red numbers and

162
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.260
we have increased the power to 99 percent.

163
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.690
Which means that almost all of the time,
you correctly conclude

164
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.600
that there is an effect when there
is a true effect to be observed.

165
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.700
Our true positive rate
has indeed increased.

166
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.260
But not so much.

167
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.180
You can see that now
it's about 94.5% likely

168
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.060
that you conclude that
there's a true positive.

169
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.380
It is now the most likely outcome but
it's not ridiculously high.

170
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.180
Another idea you might have is say,

171
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.320
well probably the false
positive rate is too high.

172
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.040
Let's reduce the false positive rate.

173
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.110
Set it at 1%.

174
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.550
So Type 1 error is now 1%.

175
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.260
And you can see where changes occur.

176
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.360
Now of course the difference is only
in the situation when no hypothesis is

177
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.610
actually true.

178
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.970
Because you can only make a Type 1
error if the no hypothesis is true.

179
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.610
So we see that there's a reduction in
the number of false positives from 2.5%.

180
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.020
Now it's only 0.5%.

181
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.520
But still,
true negatives are most likely to happen.

182
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.840
So this all doesn't really help.

183
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.670
So whats the most important thing
to do if you want to improve

184
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.650
the probability of
finding a true positive?

185
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.370
What you should do is examine
hypotheses that are likely to be true.

186
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.620
The biggest problem here is this
50/50 prior probability of the no and

187
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.430
the alternative hypothesis being true.

188
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.070
We can see that if it's above
90% probable that we are right.

189
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:48.420
That our hypothesis is 90% likely to
be true when we start data collection.

190
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.520
You can see that the probability of
a true positive increases sharply.

191
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.870
Now, I always use these calculations
whenever a masters student

192
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.610
enters my office and says,
I have a crazy idea.

193
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.090
I don't know if it's true or
not, but this is my passion,

194
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.180
this is something that I really find
interesting and I want to examine it.

195
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.190
I always say, that's perfectly fine.

196
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.020
But I don't know if
the hypothesis is true or not.

197
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.560
It's 50/50.

198
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.810
Could go either way.

199
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:17.430
So realize that the most likely outcome
of your research is a true negative.

200
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.750
If you're interested in finding.

201
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.597
Support for the alternative hypothesis,
the best thing you can do is examine

202
00:11:23.597 --> 00:11:27.343
studies that are, or examined hypotheses
that are most likely to be true.

203
00:11:29.944 --> 00:11:33.684
Now let's use a slightly different way
to think about these type one errors and

204
00:11:33.684 --> 00:11:37.190
type two errors and
true positives and true negatives.

205
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.100
This is an illustration of
the null hypothesis and

206
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.750
the alternative hypothesis in
terms of normal distributions.

207
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.880
You can visit this website and play around
with this visualization if you want to.

208
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.390
Let's look at all the different components
here because there's quite a lot of

209
00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.750
information.

210
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:59.600
Now the white bell shaped curve Is the
situation when the no hypothesis is true.

211
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.080
When there is no true
effect to be observed.

212
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.540
You can see that it centered at zero.

213
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.280
So, this reflects the situation
where the no hypothesis is true,

214
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.740
there is no true effect but,
there are some random variation.

215
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.840
Now, if we take a look a light
blue bell shaped curve

216
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.540
This is the distribution when
there is a true effect and

217
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.368
in this case there's a true effect
of a specific size, namely 0.35.

218
00:12:22.368 --> 00:12:25.560
We'll talk about effect sizes
later in the course, but for

219
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.660
now you can see that the likelihood
of finding effects that are large

220
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.680
is much more likely under
the alternative hypothesis.

221
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.523
And under the null hypothesis you'll
find effect sizes that are zero most of

222
00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:43.386
the time There's a certain
critical value that we often use,

223
00:12:43.386 --> 00:12:48.582
it's also illustrated here, and in this
case, this equals a p value of 0.05.

224
00:12:48.582 --> 00:12:51.980
So this is the critical value,
your type one error rate.

225
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.670
Now given this cutoff
off the distributions,

226
00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.330
we can make a division between the four
cells that we saw earlier, but

227
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.160
now we're visualizing it in another way.

228
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.190
If we look at the white bell shaped curve

229
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.990
the white area reflects
the true negatives.

230
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.890
There is no true effect to be observed and
we will find it a lot of the time.

231
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.500
We can also make a false positive.

232
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.670
This is still part of
the distribution Often null, so

233
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:28.350
the white curve slowly moves towards
this red are that you can see.

234
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.670
WIth the area of the false
positives pointing to it.

235
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.770
These are situations when we
observe an extreme result

236
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.810
when the null hypothesis is true.

237
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.390
We're saying that there's something, but
we're actually making a type one error

238
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.430
Now let's switch our attention
to the light blue area.

239
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:48.100
You can see that this falls on
the right side of the critical value.

240
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.780
So in this case, we are observing p
values that are smaller than 0.05 and

241
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.220
we are correctly saying
that there is an effect.

242
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.990
We're observing a significant result and
there is a true effect to be observed.

243
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.270
So the light blue area corresponds to
the true positives that we'll observe.

244
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.060
Sometimes we'll conclude
that there is no effect

245
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.360
when we're actually sampling from this
reality where this a true effect.

246
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.600
This is illustrated in the dark blue area.

247
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.150
These are false negatives.

248
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.080
The values we observe
are not extreme enough

249
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.790
to lead to a P value smaller than 0.05 So
these are false negatives.

250
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.820
Now the important question
when you're designing is,

251
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.320
which error rates should you aim for?

252
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:36.380
I already mentioned that the alpha
level in the beta that we often use

253
00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:42.024
is an all 50.05 and the beta of 20% or
a statistical power of 80%.

254
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.490
However stat decisions themselves say
you should not use these benchmarks.

255
00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:52.370
You should think for
yourself what the best choice is.

256
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.310
Neyman himself talks about it in this way.

257
00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.260
Is it more serious to convict
an innocent man, or to acquit a guilty?

258
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.290
if you're convicting an innocent man,
this person has gone nothing.

259
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.110
But you're saying this person has done
something, so this is Type 1 error.

260
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.490
If you're acquitting a guilty man,
this person has done something wrong.

261
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.790
But you're saying no crime has been
committed, so this is Type 2 error.

262
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.579
Depending on your beliefs one of these two
types of errors might be more serious.

263
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.720
In the case of medicine,

264
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.010
we can see that you have to weigh this
two types of error very carefully.

265
00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.480
If you have Type 2 error and
you are saying, you are not sick.

266
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.520
You don't need any treatment when
the person is actually sick.

267
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.350
There might be very severe consequences
and this person might die.

268
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.630
So there are more likely to
make an error whether you say,

269
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.080
you might have a specific sickness,
we're not completely sure.

270
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.487
And then follow up research will
confirm this in more extensive tests.

271
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.179
So Neyman himself says that determining
how the balance must be struck should be

272
00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:56.480
left to the investigator.

273
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.340
So it's up to you to decide
what types of errors or

274
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.470
what levels of errors you find acceptable.

275
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:07.140
You don't really need to use these
defaults although they are very tempting.

276
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.160
Cohen himself recommended
this 80% power threshold.

277
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.813
And when he did this, he explicitly hoped
that this recommendation would be ignored

278
00:16:15.813 --> 00:16:19.559
whenever you as a researcher can
make better informed judgements.

279
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.360
At our department for example, we use
typically a 90% power if we're designing

280
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.530
new studies where we hope that they will
lead to insights that we can publish.

281
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:35.600
So, we have a 90% threshold because we try
to spend the text money on research that

282
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.830
will give us informative results, even
when we don't find a significant result,

283
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.650
we want to be reasonably sure that
there's really nothing there,

284
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.890
that we didn't miss anything.

285
00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:48.270
In the case where you're
examining very impactful things,

286
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:52.370
where, if you find an effect,
you might have a real breakthrough.

287
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.490
So, missing out on a true
effect is very costly.

288
00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:00.690
You want to increase your power or reduce
your type two error as much as possible

289
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.810
Most of the scientific discoveries that
lead to Nobel prizes are discovered by

290
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.350
people between 35 and 40 years of age.` So

291
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:12.520
in my case I'm of course keeping my type
two error rate as small as possible.

292
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.090
Because at this moment when I do
a discovery and I miss out on something,

293
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:20.200
I could may be even be missing out
on a Nobel prize winning idea.

294
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.170
So for me personally, I try to have
high power and low type two error rates.

295
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.810
The type one error rate is
slightly less important.

296
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.030
At the same time,
we see that people are very,

297
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.790
very hesitant to changeType 1 error rates.

298
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:36.970
You could even increase it.

299
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.978
You could set your Type 1 error rates
to 10% and it's perfectly possible,

300
00:17:40.978 --> 00:17:44.290
If in your specific situation,
this is acceptable.

301
00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:48.320
But it's almost like Moses came
down from the Mount Sinai and

302
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.940
he had this tablet with
a ten commandments and

303
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.240
one of them was you will
always set your alpha to 0.05.

304
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.710
People are very hesitant to change this
but if you really know what you're

305
00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:03.860
doing and you're making an informed
judgement, this is perfectly possible.

306
00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.920
So it's very useful to think
about how you can control your

307
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.340
error rates when you're
designing a new study.

308
00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.118
You want to minimize one or
both of these types of errors, so

309
00:18:13.118 --> 00:18:17.679
that in the long run, you won't make
a fool out of yourself too often.

310
00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:22.089
