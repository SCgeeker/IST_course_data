00:00:09.127 --> 00:00:14.460
Hi, welcome to this course where we'll try
to improve your statistical inferences.

3
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.720
My name is Daniel Lakens,
I'm an experimental psychologist working

4
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.160
at the Human-Technology Interaction group
at Eindhoven University of Technology.

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.550
Now, some years after I completed my Ph.D,
I realized that my understanding of

6
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.980
statistics was actually not good
enough to design a proper study.

7
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.580
I joined the Reproducibility Project

8
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.040
which has the goal to reproduce
100 studies in psychology.

9
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.690
And when I started to perform
the replication study that I would do,

10
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.940
I realized that I had to
calculate an effect size

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.430
to perform an a priori power analysis.

12
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.264
Now, this is a very basic first
step when you design a new study,

13
00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:57.238
whether it's a completely new study or
a replication study, it doesn't matter.

14
00:00:57.238 --> 00:00:59.447
I realized I didn't really
know how to do this.

15
00:00:59.447 --> 00:01:02.708
And then I wondered, well,
if I don't know to do this very first,

16
00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:06.180
basic thing,
how can I ever collect informative data?

17
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.590
Since then, I've been looking into how to
improve the way that we design studies and

18
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.910
draw inferences from data.

19
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.000
I published some papers on this, and

20
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.430
I've realized that improving the
statistical understanding of how you do

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.070
research really makes you a more
efficient and better researcher.

22
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.950
So I'll share some of the insights I had,
and I'll try to prevent some confusion

23
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.040
that you might have about
statistical tools that we use.

24
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.460
The goal of this is to try to
prevent you from fooling yourself.

25
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.130
As Feynman reminds us, the first principle
in doing science is that you must not fool

26
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.850
yourself- and
you are the easiest person to fool.

27
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.360
So I see a better understanding
of statistics as a very good way

28
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.620
to try to prevent you
from fooling yourself.

29
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.440
Now, as an experimental researcher, the
goal might not be to do statistical tests,

30
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.010
itself.

31
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.830
What you always want to do is
to say something about a theory.

32
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.190
So the goal of data collection is to
first draw statistical inferences and

33
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.400
then to draw theoretical inferences.

34
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.220
That's what you really want to know.

35
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.690
But, of course, you need to draw a good
and valid statistical inferences

36
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.530
because otherwise the next
step doesn't really work.

37
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.236
So let's try to improve this step.

38
00:02:20.028 --> 00:02:23.797
There's a reason why psychologists,
maybe scientists more generally,

39
00:02:23.797 --> 00:02:27.165
are now really interested in
improving statistical inferences.

40
00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:31.813
And one of the first reasons for
starting on this improvement cycle was

41
00:02:31.813 --> 00:02:35.060
a study published by
Daryl Bem on precognition.

42
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.080
Precognition is the idea that
we can predict the future.

43
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.080
Now, you might believed that
this is possible or not, but

44
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.190
as a scientist we should always keep
an open mind and look at the evidence.

45
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.710
In this case, there was a set of nine
published studies that all showed

46
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.990
support for the idea that people
could predict the future.

47
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.570
There were very simple basic tasks that
were performed that are widely used in

48
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.380
experimental psychology, but
the tasks were always reversed.

49
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.680
So instead of first seeing a picture and
then pressing a button to

50
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.740
categorize the picture, the task was
presented in the reversed order.

51
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.890
People first had to press a button, and
only then the picture would emerge.

52
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.430
So, of course,

53
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.678
you don't really know what to press
unless you can predict the future.

54
00:03:19.678 --> 00:03:21.150
And in this set of studies,

55
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.490
people were able to perform above guessing
average in most of these studies.

56
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.561
So after this, maybe some people
thought precognition must be real.

57
00:03:30.561 --> 00:03:34.629
But other people thought, well, if this is
going to be published in one of the top

58
00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.515
journals in our field then maybe we
are not drawing the correct statistical

59
00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:42.110
inferences from data because it
seemed unlikely that this was true.

60
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.350
There has been more criticism
in the scientific literature on

61
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.140
how we draw inferences from data.

62
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.090
Now, there are some people who
even go as far as to say that most

63
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.110
published research findings are false.

64
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.650
Is this true?

65
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.720
What do you think?

66
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.460
Do you think that most of the scientific
literature is false or not?

67
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.890
I think the answer is
we don't really know.

68
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.740
We can try to estimate it, but
we don't really have an accurate number.

69
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.120
It's more important, probably, to try to
improve the way that we do research to

70
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.580
prevent this from continuing on, so that
in the future we know that the data that's

71
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.620
generated and the conclusions that
are drawn are most likely to be correct.

72
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.930
There are some problems in
the scientific literature at the moment.

73
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.430
We know that many of the sample
sizes we collect are too small, so

74
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.850
we have underpowered studies.

75
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.570
We know that people are very
flexible in how they analyze data.

76
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.720
So this leads to a lot of flukes,
random findings,

77
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.150
that are actually not true, but
people interpret as a true effect.

78
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.020
And we know that there is
strong publication bias.

79
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.510
People share findings that show an effect,
but

80
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.640
they don't share findings
that do not show an effect.

81
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.600
And all these things
make it very difficult

82
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.020
to conclude whether published
findings are reliable or not.

83
00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.000
And the goal in this course is to try to
give you some tools to try this question

84
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.035
better, given that there's publication
bias, flexibility in the data analysis and

85
00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:08.099
low-powered studies.

86
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.457
So, first of all,

87
00:05:11.457 --> 00:05:15.280
we'll try to make sure that you can
draw better statistical inferences.

88
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.450
To achieve this we'll talk about p-values
and how to interpret them, report and

89
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.730
calculate effect sizes and confidence
intervals, but also discuss alternative

90
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.660
ways and frequentist statistics such
as Bayes Factors or likelihoods.

91
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.620
The second goal is to enable you to
design more informative experiments.

92
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.270
To achieve this, we'll talk about how you
can control error rates when you design

93
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.370
studies, how you can efficiently
run high-powered studies.

94
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.060
But we'll also focus a little
bit on theory construction.

95
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.200
Another goal is to evaluate
the evidence in the literature,

96
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.350
given that there is publication bias.

97
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.510
We'll talk about p-curve analysis,
and we'll discuss publication bias and

98
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.750
some ways to identify this in more detail.

99
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.140
Finally, an important goal is to
facilitate cumulative science.

100
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.350
Of course,
we try to improve our knowledge.

101
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.730
How can we do this the best way?

102
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.300
We'll talk about how you can
perform replication studies,

103
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.890
the importance of pre-registration and the
benefits of using pre-registration, and

104
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.839
the importance of adhering to open
science principles in your research.

105
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.260
Accompanying these
lectures are assignments,

106
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.590
and these assignments are really
hands on and in depth knowledge.

107
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.938
The goal is to learn mainly
through simulations.

108
00:06:31.938 --> 00:06:35.780
I'm not a big fan of teaching
through formulas, myself.

109
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.940
If you're interested in that,
you can easily look up the literature and

110
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.255
I'll provide references where
these formulas are discussed.

111
00:06:42.255 --> 00:06:46.100
But in these assignments, we'll mainly
rely on performing simulation studies, and

112
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.460
just seeing what happens in
the long run when you would perform

113
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.720
hundreds of thousands of studies.

114
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.510
Personally, I've found
that really informative

115
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.549
when I tried to understand
statistics myself.

116
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.410
We'll use R, which is free software.

117
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.710
You don't need to have a very good
understanding of how R works.

118
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.610
We'll typically use very simple examples
where you can just run the code,

119
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.803
maybe change one or two numbers.

120
00:07:11.803 --> 00:07:15.303
That's really all you need
to know about how R works.

121
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.358
Now, personally, as I started to get
a better understanding of statistics,

122
00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:23.058
I felt much less uncertain and

123
00:07:23.058 --> 00:07:27.410
much more able to draw correct inferences
from the scientific literature,

124
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.956
and to design studies that would
yield informative results.

125
00:07:30.956 --> 00:07:34.739
I really think that if you want to be a
good researcher, it's important to invest

126
00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:38.530
some time in learning how to draw
better inferences from your data.

127
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.420
And it can be remarkable fun,
getting this better understanding.

128
00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.130
If you want to reach out to me,

129
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.370
you can contact me at Twitter with any
questions or comments you might have.

130
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:50.955
For now, let's get started.

131
00:07:50.955 --> 00:07:55.639
