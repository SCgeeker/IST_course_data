2  
00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:11.430    
In this lecture we talk    
about open science.    
最後一講來談開放科學    
  
3  
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.760  
We see in recent years that the scientific  
community is moving towards more  
近年，學界持續開放知識生產流程    
的所有環節，讓科學活動更透明    
  
4  
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.430  
transparency opening up all aspect  
of the scientific enterprise.  
近年，學界持續開放科學知識生產流程    
的所有環節，讓科學活動更透明    
  
5  
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.927  
We'll discuss what's happening and  
這一講會談正在進行的活動    
  
6  
00:00:22.927 --> 00:00:26.757  
wether you want to join into  
this open science movements.  
還有提供你加入開放科學運動的建議-    
  
7  
00:00:26.757 --> 00:00:32.620  
So open science can be divided to,  
maybe six different aspecs.  
開放科學大致可分成六個面向    
(註：https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science)  
  
8  
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.680  
You have open access to publications,    
data,    
有出版品的開放檢索、研究資料的開放取用    
  
9  
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.790  
materials that are used in scientific  
research, to peer review process,  
研究材料的開放取用    
同儕審查程序的透明化    
  
10  
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.429  
educational resources and  
open source software.  
公開的教育資源以及開源軟體    
  
11  
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.700    
Let's talk about all of these in term.    
以下讓我逐項介紹    
  
12  
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.580    
First, open access to    
the scientific output.    
首先談科學成果的開放檢索    
  
13  
00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.500  
It might sound like it's a good idea  
that whenever a taxpayer pays for  
現代科學研究主要來自人民納稅的國家經費補助    
所有納稅人都能檢索研究成果是合理的主張    
  
14  
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.630  
scientific research, this taxpayer  
also has access to the publications  
現代科學研究主要來自人民納稅的國家經費補助    
所有納稅人都能檢索研究成果是合理的主張    
  
15  
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.950  
that come out of this research.  
現代科學研究主要來自人民納稅的國家經費補助    
所有納稅人都能檢索研究成果是合理的主張    
  
16  
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.880  
Regrettably at the moment this is not yet  
the case.    
很可惜目前還未能達成    
  
17  
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.530  
If someone wants to read  
the scientific article  
想要閱讀科學論文的讀者    
  
18  
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.120  
here she has to pay to  
get access this article.  
必須付費購買檢索權限    
  
19  
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.790  
This is now an ideal situation and  
everybody agrees.  
全面開放還是多數人希望達成的理想境界    
  
20  
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.580  
We see a move towards open access  
現在有一些開放模式提供人們免費檢索科學文獻    
  
21  
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.540  
providing people with access to  
the scientific literature without paying.  
現在有一些開放模式提供人們免費檢索科學文獻    
  
22  
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.140  
There are different models to achieve  
this one is called Gold Open Access.  
其中一種稱為付費式開放檢索  
(Gold Open Access)  
  
23  
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.700  
In this case the researcher or  
這種模式由研究者本人或任職的大學付檢索費    
  
24  
00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.160  
the university the researcher works for  
have payed to provide access.  
這種模式由研究者本人或任職的大學付檢索費    
  
25  
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.980  
Another option is Green Open Access.  
另一種稱為自由式開放檢索    
(Green Open Access)  
  
26  
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.200  
Here the scientific output is still  
hidden behind what's known as a paywall.  
這種模式還是需要付出一些費用    
  
27  
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.230  
But a version of the publication,  
typically just the Word document,  
不過任何人都可以上網閱覽通常是Word格式的文獻手稿    
  
28  
00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:52.660  
is available for  
anyone who wants to read it online.  
不過任何人都可以上網閱覽通常是Word格式的文獻手稿    
  
29  
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.760  
Nowadays we even have less legal  
solutions to this problem.  
現在還有一種不完全合法的開放檢索管道    
  
30  
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.610  
There's a website Sci-Hub which provides  
access to all the scientific literature  
這是由Sci-Hub網站提供的全球科學文獻檢索服務    
  
31  
00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.510  
without having to pay but of course this  
is completely illegal at the moment.  
Sci-Hub雖不收費但是目前未完全合法    
  
32  
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.750  
That such a service exists shows that  
there's a big problem at the moment.  
Sci-Hub的存在顯現達到完全的開放檢索還有問題要克服    
  
33  
00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.010  
And I think that in a couple of years  
we'll see a big move towards open access  
我認為幾年之內開放檢索會有重大進展    
  
34  
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.120  
and, hopefully,  
而且希望任何有興趣科學研究的個人都能自由檢索科學文獻    
  
35  
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.651  
making scientific literature available  
to anybody who's interested in it.  
而且希望任何有興趣科學研究的個人都能自由檢索科學文獻    
  
36  
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.910  
If you publish a scientific article,  
you can see whether you're  
若你是科學論文的作者，你可以查詢接受出版的期刊是否允許分享己接受或待出版的手稿    
  
37  
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.450  
actually allowed to share a pre-print or  
a post print to show the word document  
若你是科學論文的作者，你可以查詢接受出版的期刊是否允許分享己接受或待出版的手稿    
  
38  
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.650  
that you submitted to the journal  
before publication on a website.  
若你是科學論文的作者，你可以查詢接受出版的期刊是否允許分享己接受或待出版的手稿    
  
39  
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.050  
So you can share this version for  
anybody to read.  
這類論文格式你可以自行決定分享的方式    
  
40  
00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.000  
So this is green open access model.  
所以這是一種自由式開放檢索    
(例:academica.edu, researchgate)    
  
41  
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.520  
So, if you visit this website SHERPA/ROMEO  
只要在SHERPA/ROMEO網站查詢  
  
42  
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.000  
you can see whether you're allowed  
to share your scientific output.  
就能得知出版文章的期刊有無允許你分享    
  
43  
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.700  
And this is always a smart thing to do.  
這是現在最好的公開模式    
  
44  
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.180  
Research shows that people who put  
this free available versions online  
研究者以合法途徑於網路免費分享人人可取用的格式，也能提高研究成果的被引用次數    
  
45  
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.860  
the legal way get more citations  
in their scientific research.  
研究者以合法途徑於網路免費分享人人可取用的格式，也能提高研究成果的被引用次數    
  
46  
00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.790  
So this is nice,  
可說是兩全其美    
  
47  
00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.859  
people can read it and they'll cite it  
more as long as you make it available.  
只要能持續分享，人人都能閱讀你的文章並引用之    
  
48  
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.080  
The second point is sharing  
data after publication.  
接著談出版論文後的資料分享    
  
49  
00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.810  
When you do this science  
becomes more reproducible.  
你可以讓你的科學成果更容易被重製    
  
50  
00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.660  
People can take your data and they can  
rerun the analysis that you report.  
人人都能拿你的資料重新驗證報告中的分析結果     
  
51  
00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.909  
They can even try out different analysis  
if they are interested in doing this.  
其它人也能嘗試用其它方法分析你的資料-    
  
52  
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.270  
Data storage itself is not  
organized through laws,  
資料的儲存沒有任何法律規範    
  
53  
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.820  
there's no law that says that you have  
to store your data somewhere, but  
沒有那條法規律定資料存放位置    
  
54  
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.985  
it's regulated through regulations.  
不過通常有公約規範    
  
55  
00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:36.365  
They're very often,  
scientific institutions such as  
許多科學機構像是荷蘭大學協會(VSNU)有頒布指導原則    
(有意留學荷蘭的同學留意屬於VSNU的大學)    
  
56  
00:03:36.365 --> 00:03:40.875    
the Dutch Association for universities in    
the Netherlands that have guidelines and    
許多科學機構像是荷蘭大學協會(VSNU)有頒布指導原則    
(有意留學荷蘭的同學留意屬於VSNU的大學)    
  
57  
00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:44.895  
ask researchers to for  
example store their data for 10 years.  
要求各校研究者要保存資料至少十年    
(有意留學荷蘭的同學留意屬於VSNU的大學)    
  
58  
00:03:46.195 --> 00:03:49.855  
Now if you collect scientific data and  
you publish it, you are require  
像我收集的資料在發表論文之後，就要從出版日期開始保存至少十年    
  
59  
00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:53.819  
to make this data available until at  
least 10 years after publication.  
像我收集的資料在發表論文之後，就要從出版日期開始保存至少十年-    
  
60  
00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.360  
So data should be made  
available upon request.  
只要有需求就要保持資料可被取用    
  
61  
00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.280  
When other people in  
the scientific community ask for  
只要有其它研究者向你索取資料，你應該在起碼合法範圍內與人分享    
  
62  
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.450  
your data, you should share this at  
least whenever it's legally possible.  
只要有其它研究者向你索取資料，你應該在起碼合法範圍內與人分享    
  
63  
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.750  
Now if your department  
has no central rules for  
如果你任職的單位沒有訂研究資料儲存的規則，就是你個人要付起的責任    
  
64  
00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.870  
data storage, then data storage  
is your own responsibility.  
如果你任職的單位沒有訂研究資料儲存的規則，就是你個人要付起的責任    
  
65  
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.000  
Don't store your data on the hard drive  
of a single laptop or even worse,  
千萬不要把研究資料存在筆記型電腦的硬碟或隨身碟之中    
  
66  
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.550  
on a USB stick.  
千萬不要把研究資料存在筆記型電腦的硬碟或隨身碟之中    
  
67  
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:22.070  
The data might just disappear.  
因為硬碟有可能損壞    
  
68  
00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.730  
The hard drive might crash and  
the data is gone.  
導致資料遺失    
  
69  
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.390  
So it's your responsibility  
to make sure that in five,  
你的個人責任是維持至少五、六年之內，其它人都能檢索你收集的資料    
  
70  
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.159  
six years from now people can still have  
access to the data that you collected.  
你的個人責任是維持至少五,六年之內，其它人都能檢索你收集的資料    
  
71  
00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.190  
Often when you analyze data, you will also  
be able to provide an analysis script.  
提供資料之外，最好也提供分析資料的程式碼腳本    
  
72  
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.990  
When you do this,  
我建議在程式碼中    
  
73  
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.400  
try to add comments to whatever  
code you use to analyze your data.  
加上附註說明每一行進行的分析程序    
  
74  
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.280  
This is not just useful for other  
people but it will also be useful for  
這不但有助其他人理解，你自已也能容易回憶這時做過的事情    
  
75  
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.279  
yourself in the future so that you can  
understand your own code more easily.  
這不但有助其他人理解，你自已也能容易回憶這時做過的事情    
  
76  
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.750  
If you create a data file,  
give names to the data.  
還有給予每個資料欄位合適命名    
  
77  
00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.790  
Provide useful names that  
people can understand.  
欄位命名能幫助他人了解資料內容    
  
78  
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.650  
Again this is useful for other people  
who want to look at your data later, but  
與程式碼註解相同，這能幫助他人理解你的資料    
  
79  
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.480  
it is also useful if you want to look  
at your own data in a couple of years.  
你自已將來有天重新查閱時也容易整理    
  
80  
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.060  
Ideally, when you publish  
a scientific article,  
原則上，一篇論文出版之後    
  
81  
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.940  
you will provide the raw data,  
the analytic data and the results.  
需要提供原始資料(raw data)，分析資料(analytic data)與結果圖表    
  
82  
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:21.670  
The raw data is the data as you  
collect it with whatever software or  
原始資料來自你使用的資料收集軟體或問卷    
  
83  
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.040  
whatever questionnaires you use.  
原始資料來自你使用的資料收集軟體或問卷    
  
84  
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.060  
Then you can typically use  
some sort of analysis script  
接著會用某種分析腳本將原始資料轉換成分析資料    
  
85  
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.870  
that transform the raw data  
into the analytic data.  
接著會用某種分析腳本將原始資料轉換成分析資料    
  
86  
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.310  
This includes removing outliers or  
dealing with missing data.  
這個過程包括去掉極端值或處理遺漏值    
  
87  
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.540  
And it might also include calculating  
averages from questionnaires.  
也許還有計算幾組平均值    
  
88  
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.870  
When you have the analytic data then  
you have the second set of goal that  
有了分析資料，接下來就要製作放在論文結果一節的圖表  
  
89  
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.200  
creates the results section as you write  
it down in your scientific article.  
有了分析資料，接下來就要製作放在論文結果一節的圖表  
  
90  
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.100  
And you might even be able to provide  
additional quote from these results that  
通常會在圖表旁邊提供附加說明，圖表的元素表示那些資料    
  
91  
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.950  
lead to figures that you publish in the  
article, or tables that you have produced.  
通常會在圖表旁邊提供附加說明，圖表的元素表示那些資料    
  
92  
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:03.110  
So in the ideal situation, the data  
that you share goes from the raw data to  
最理想的狀況是你能提供從原始資料，轉換成分析資料，最後形成圖表元素的一切  
  
93  
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.740  
the analytic data to the results and then  
directly to the figures and the tables.  
最理想的狀況是你能提供從原始資料，轉換成分析資料，最後形成圖表元素的一切  
  
94  
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.670  
So this would create a completely  
reproducible result section.  
如此就是可再製的研究結果-    
(延伸:http://danielmarcelino.github.io/blog/2016/reproducible-research.html)  
  
95  
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.360  
There are some journals that require  
all authors to make all data underlying  
有些期刊要求投稿者公開論文裡提及的所有資料  
  
96  
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.370  
the findings described in their manuscript  
fully available without restriction,  
有些期刊要求投稿者公開論文裡提及的所有資料  
  
97  
00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.530  
with very rare exceptions.  
除了極少的例外狀況    
  
98  
00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.040  
PLOS is one of the journals  
that does this.  
PLOS是這類期刊之一    
  
99  
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.360  
You might have data that's  
really too sensitive to share.  
也許有時一些資料比較敏感不宜公開    
  
100  
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.160  
But in most situations the expectation is  
that whenever someone in the scientific  
但多數情況是有同行研究者索取資料，你有義務完整提供    
  
101  
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.990  
community asks for your data,  
you'll make it fully available.  
但多數情況是有同行研究者索取資料，你有義務完整提供    
  
102  
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:44.070  
So it's useful to prepare a data file that  
can be easily shared with other people  
因此投稿時準備好可分享的研究資料是很有用的習慣    
  
103  
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:47.039  
when you submit your scientific  
findings for publication.  
因此投稿時準備好可分享的研究資料是很有用的習慣-    
  
104  
00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.890  
Many science funders now require what's  
known as a data management plan.  
許多研究經費補助單位開始要求提出資料管理計畫    
(台灣的科技部推給各IRB?)    
  
105  
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:58.810  
Whenever they fund scientific research,  
they expect that the researcher that  
補助者期望研究者展示如何在約定年限內(5~10年）儲存資料的方式    
  
106  
00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.080  
performs this research has some idea  
of how the data will be stored for  
補助者期望研究者展示如何在約定年限內(5~10年）儲存資料的方式    
  
107  
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.159  
the foreseeable future.  
補助者期望研究者展示如何在約定年限內(5~10年）儲存資料的方式    
  
108  
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:10.540  
There are all sorts of technological  
solutions nowadays to store data.  
今天有許多提供儲存各式資料的雲端服務    
  
109  
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:13.610  
Because we have the Internet,  
we can share data in the cloud.  
這些平台讓我們能透過網路分析資料    
  
110  
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:17.088  
And there are all sorts of services  
that allow you to upload data files and  
這張投影片列舉的平台都能讓你上傳及分享研究資料    
  
111  
00:07:17.088 --> 00:07:18.580  
share them with other people.  
這張投影片列舉的平台都能讓你上傳及分享研究資料-    
  
112  
00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:25.580  
From data we can also move  
on to sharing materials.  
除了資料我們也可以分享研究材料    
  
113  
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.830  
If you've published something and you  
share all the materials that you used in  
將原始論文中的研究材料公開更能有效促進科學知識進步    
  
114  
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.570  
your original research, this will  
make science much more efficient.  
將原始論文中的研究材料公開更能有效促進科學知識進步    
  
115  
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.800  
Other people can use the same materials  
either to try to replicate your result or  
其它人能用同樣的材料進行再現研究(見本週第一講)    
  
116  
00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.829  
to build on it and  
to test new theoretical prediction.  
也能用設計新研究測試新理論-    
  
117  
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.670  
The Open Science Framework is a free  
servers that allows researchers to share  
開放科學平台(osf.io)是提供研究同伴間分享研究材料與資料的免費雲端服務    
  
118  
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:50.820  
whatever they want, materials but  
also data with fellow scientists or  
開放科學平台(osf.io)是提供研究同伴間分享研究材料與資料的免費雲端服務    
  
119  
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.140  
anybody who wants access to it.  
任何人都能取用公開的檔案    
  
120  
00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.070  
On the right you see a list of  
files that we've share to relate it  
投影片右邊是我的某份已出版研究的材料清單    
  
121  
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:57.889  
to a research project that we published.  
投影片右邊是我的某份已出版研究的材料清單    
  
122  
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:01.730  
You can see that we share  
the questionnaire that we use so  
如果你想進行有關的研究    
  
123  
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.770  
other people can use the same  
questionnaire if they want.  
你可以直接下載這份研究使用的問卷    
  
124  
00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:09.460  
But we also share some sound files  
that were used in this studies.  
此外也分享這項研究使用的語音檔案    
  
125  
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:14.010  
Of course in the publication we tried to  
described the content of the sound files,  
雖然內容很複雜，我在論文中已儘可能描述語音內容    
  
126  
00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:15.510  
but that's very difficult.  
雖然內容很複雜，我在論文中已儘可能描述語音內容    
  
127  
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:19.350  
And by just giving people access to the  
sound files that we used, we can make it  
提供語音檔案能讓其它人更容易了解我們的研究方法  
  
128  
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:23.310  
as easy as possible for other people  
to understand what we did exactly and  
提供語音檔案能讓其它人更容易了解我們的研究方法  
  
129  
00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:25.320  
to build on this line of  
research if they want to.  
也能幫助之後的研究者建立研究進程-    
  
130  
00:08:28.385 --> 00:08:31.820  
Nowadays we're trying to reward  
these kind of practices.  
現在已有獎勵這些公開行為的措施    
  
131  
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:35.720  
One example of a reward  
program is the use of badges.  
其中一項是頒發獎章    
  
132  
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.390  
Whenever you publish research,  
只要你成功發表的研究論文  
  
133  
00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.920  
where you make data openly available,  
materials openly available or  
有做到開放資料、開放研究材料    
  
134  
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:46.170  
where you have pre-registered your  
hypothesis before collecting the data.  
或者收集資料前完成註冊    
  
135  
00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.170  
This will be clearly marked.  
你的論文就會獲得這些獎章    
  
136  
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.850  
Now it might sound a little bit  
like you're back in kindergarten.  
這看起來有點像幼稚園園長的管理方法  
  
137  
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.834  
Whenever you perform good behavior you get  
a sticker, but making these good behaviors  
小朋友表現好就給一支棒棒糖，不過這樣的方式是讓開放科學的重要性能清楚呈現於世人之前    
  
138  
00:08:55.834 --> 00:08:59.598  
clearly visible is an important  
aspect of promoting open science  
小朋友表現好就給一支棒棒糖，不過這樣的方式是讓開放科學的重要性能清楚呈現於世人之前-    
  
139  
00:09:01.897 --> 00:09:06.510  
Another aspect of open science is  
opening the peer review process.  
開放的同儕審查是開放科學的另一項重點    
  
140  
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.120  
The goal of this is to make  
science more transparent.  
目的是讓科學更透明    
  
141  
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:16.190  
We can see that some journals are now not  
just publishing their research itself,  
例如這本期刊不只刊出接受的研究論文    
  
142  
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.739  
they also provide access  
to the peer review history.  
也提供讀者查閱論文的審查紀錄     
  
143  
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.140  
When an article is submitted for  
作者投出一篇文章後，通常有數位審查者評估論文品質    
  
144  
00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.460  
publication, peers evaluate  
the quality of the article.  
作者投出一篇文章後，通常有數位審查者評估論文品質    
  
145  
00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:29.270  
By giving access to the peer review  
history, you can see the communication  
從審查紀錄之中可以看到論文被正式接受之前審查者的意見    
  
146  
00:09:29.270 --> 00:09:32.660  
between peers before the final  
version of the article was published.  
從審查紀錄之中可以看到論文被正式接受之前審查者的意見    
  
147  
00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:36.499  
This gives more transparency  
to the Peer Review Process.  
如此能讓同儕審查程序更透明    
  
148  
00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:43.960  
A final aspect that I want to mention  
is the use of open source software.  
最後一項是開源軟體的使用    
  
149  
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.380  
The goal of using open source  
software is making data and  
使用開源軟體能讓其它人不需購買商用軟體    
就能取用研究資料與分析程序  
  
150  
00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:50.910  
analyses more available,  
more accessible to people that  
使用開源軟體能讓其它人不需購買商用軟體    
就能取用研究資料與分析程序  
  
151  
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.929  
might not be able to buy  
commercially available software.  
使用開源軟體能讓其它人不需購買商用軟體    
就能取用研究資料與分析程序-    
  
152  
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.960  
For example in this course, we rely on R.  
例如本課程大量使用的R語言    
  
153  
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.380  
Free statistical software that anybody  
with access to a computer can download.  
就是只要能使用電腦上網的使用者都能下載的軟體    
  
154  
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:07.370  
If we would use commercially  
available statistical tools,  
如果使用商用統計軟體(如SPSS,Matlab)  
  
155  
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:11.940  
then we would rely on people to be able to  
buy the software before they can follow  
必須指望使用者能在做作業或分析資料前能買到這些軟體    
  
156  
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.640  
along with assignments or  
sometimes with analyzing data.  
必須指望使用者能在做作業或分析資料前能買到這些軟體    
  
157  
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.060  
And this is something we want to prevent.  
這是設計研究時必須避免的    
  
158  
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.803  
We want to make the data as accessible as  
possible to as many people as possible.  
研究的資料要讓越多人容易取用越好-    
  
159  
00:10:25.078 --> 00:10:28.852  
Another thing to keep in mind,  
in terms of transparency,  
另外讓科學知識更透明的重點是揭露利益衝突(conflicts of inteest)  
  
160  
00:10:28.852 --> 00:10:31.400  
is to disclose conflicts of interest.  
另外讓科學知識更透明的重點是揭露利益衝突(conflicts of interest)  
  
161  
00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:37.750  
When personal interests potentially  
compromise scientific objectivity,  
當個人利益與科學客觀性有抵觸時    
  
162  
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:43.000  
you're supposed to disclose this for  
example, when you were refueling(reviewing) articles  
像是你正在審查或發表與個人有關文章  
  
163  
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.900  
or when you're publishing  
scientific articles yourself.  
都要坦白涉及的利益關係    
  
164  
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:52.290  
The example of this where conflicts of  
interest we're not this closed comes from  
一個著名的例子是菸草工業試圖干涉研究者，發表支持「吸煙不一定會致癌」的研究結果    
  
165  
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:58.930  
the tobacco industry which try to cast  
doubt on smoking causing cancer by making  
一個著名的例子是菸草工業試圖干涉研究者，發表支持「吸煙不一定會致癌」的研究結果    
  
166  
00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:04.490  
statements such as there is no conclusive  
proof that smoking causes cancer.  
一個著名的例子是菸草工業試圖干涉研究者，發表支持「吸煙不一定會致癌」的研究結果    
  
167  
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.130  
Now of course this first  
of all shows they were not  
菸草公司的意圖並不是基於科學哲學的理由    
  
168  
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.370  
really well first in  
philosophy of science.  
菸草公司的意圖並不是基於科學哲學的理由    
  
169  
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:13.110  
We can never have conclusive  
proof of anything.    
試圖證明科學永遠不能證明任何事實    
  
170  
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:15.150  
Well there was overwhelming support for  
今天已有成千上萬的研究結果支持吸煙與癌症的關係    
  
171  
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:18.440  
the idea that there was a relationship  
between smoking and cancer.  
今天已有成千上萬的研究結果支持吸煙與癌症的關係    
  
172  
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.820  
Of course, some researchers working for  
the tobacco industry, did not disclose  
然而過去有些為菸草公司工作的研究者，並沒有完全揭露個人與公司之間的關係    
  
173  
00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.130  
these conflicts of interest and  
try to cause doubt on this relationship.  
然而過去有些為菸草公司工作的研究者，並沒有完全揭露個人與公司之間的關係    
  
174  
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:28.015  
This should be prevented.  
這是必須避免的利益衝究情況    
  
175  
00:11:30.546 --> 00:11:33.632  
You might think that people  
want to practice open science,  
最後來談落實開放科學的難處    
  
176  
00:11:33.632 --> 00:11:36.420  
why wouldn't the scientist  
practice open science?  
為何不是所有科學家都願意落實？    
  
177  
00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.630  
Well, one reason for  
其中一個難處    
  
178  
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:43.720  
this is that scientific research can  
be quite a competitive enterprise.  
是科學研究者之間的競爭    
  
179  
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:48.630  
We see that scientists try to,  
not only further scientific research, but  
研究者不單是沉浸在科學研究而已    
  
180  
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:51.600  
also further their own scientific careers.  
他們更要拓展自己的學術生涯    
  
181  
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.990  
And in these aspects sharing things, like  
your research materials and your data,  
然而，與他人分享研究材料與資料    
  
182  
00:11:55.990 --> 00:12:00.300  
with other people is not always  
immediately to your own benefit.  
並不會有立即的獲利    
  
183  
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:02.840  
We can see this as a social dilemma.  
這就像是兩難困境(Dawes, 1980)   
  
184  
00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.460  
If everybody would do this,  
science benefits.  
若大家都願意分享，則有助整體    
  
185  
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:11.120  
But if I don't do it but other people  
do it, I benefit more because,  
但若不與他分享，則個人獲益較多    
  
186  
00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.700  
I don't have to invest anything but  
I do reap the benefits.  
你就像是漁翁得利裡的漁夫    
  
187  
00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.120  
So in this social dilemmas,  
在這種兩難困境裡    
  
188  
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.100  
it sometimes necessary to convince  
people to practice open science.  
有時開放科學的落實需要些外力 
  
189  
00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:24.459  
And we see that governments, who very  
often found scientific research start to  
像是政府補助就能奏效  
  
190  
00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:28.640  
acquire that researchers adhere to  
open science principles more and more.  
以施政鼓勵研究者們落實開放科學原則-    
  
191  
00:12:30.754 --> 00:12:31.983  
Now in recent years,  
近幾年    
  
192  
00:12:31.983 --> 00:12:37.220  
this discussion is increasing because  
technology makes open science possible.  
因為促進開放科學的科技逐漸成熟，這樣的討論越來越多    
  
193  
00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:40.340  
It was very difficult to share  
your research materials or  
一百年前的研究者很難分享研究材料與資料    
  
194  
00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:43.050  
your raw data 100 years ago.  
一百年前的研究者很難分享研究材料與資料    
  
195  
00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.460  
But now all the technological  
challenges have been solved.  
但是現在的技術難題都已經被克服    
  
196  
00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:48.570  
So it's possible to do this.  
已無實踐的阻礙-    
  
197  
00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:51.760  
The question now becomes whether  
you're interested in adhering  
現在的問題在於研究者投入開放科學的意願    
  
198  
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.870  
to this open science practices.  
現在的問題在於研究者投入開放科學的意願    
  
199  
00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:56.790  
You might either do this because  
you're a science funder requires  
也許是研究經費補助單位的要求    
  
200  
00:12:56.790 --> 00:12:58.710  
you to follow open science principles and  
研究者被迫分享資料，才能獲得收入等等     
  
201  
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:03.470  
share all the data that was generated  
by tech's money for example.
