[淺談貝氏統計]  
  
2  
00:00:08.477 --> 00:00:12.890  
In this lecture we'll talk  
about Bayesian statistics.  
這一講來談談貝氏統計    
  
3  
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.190  
In a previous lecture we talked about  
likelihoods and expressing relative  
前一講介紹似然性，以及如何表達證據支持兩種假設的相對程度    
  
4  
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.410  
evidence for one hypothesis compared  
to an alternative hypothesis.  
前一講介紹似然性，以及如何表達證據支持兩種假設的相對程度    
  
5  
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.810  
And we've used evidence in this sense just  
based on the data that we have at hand.  
這讓我們能用手上的資料做為證據    
  
6  
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.960  
But we'll see that very often you have  
some prior belief that you might want to  
貝氏統計能結合證據與根據假設的事前信念(prior)，計算推論的可靠性    
  
7  
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.460  
incorporate with the evidence and  
Bayesian statistics allows you to do this.  
貝氏統計能結合證據與根據假設的事前信念(prior)，計算推論的可靠性    
  
8  
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.490  
Now let's say that you  
flip a coin three times.  
假想一枚硬幣丟了三次    
  
9  
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.860  
The coin comes up heads every single time.  
每一次都是正面朝上的結果    
  
10  
00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.420  
Now do you think that this  
is a fair coin or not?  
根據這個結果能判斷這是枚公正硬幣嗎？    
  
11  
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.440  
The data that you have at hand shows that  
this coin came up heads three times.  
因為眼前的資料是三次正面朝上    
   
12  
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.380  
So if you would be a newborn baby  
then you don't have any prior beliefs and  
對一位全無任何事前信念的新生兒來說    
  
13  
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.520  
all you have is the data  
that you just observed.  
只有眼前看到的資料    
  
14  
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.810  
So for a newborn  
it comes up heads every single time.  
新生兒會認為這枚硬幣總會擲出正面朝上    
  
15  
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.030  
This is just what this coin does.  
正如現在看到的事實    
  
16  
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.100  
But you have prior beliefs  
that most coins are fair.  
對於會看這部影片的大人來說，都有多數硬幣是公正的信念    
  
17  
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.230  
You might think  
你也許認為就算現在是這種結果    
  
18  
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.030  
Three heads in a row  
that's a perfectly likely observation.  
也只是剛好看到三枚正面朝上而已    
  
19  
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.250  
I'm not changing my prior beliefs  
that this is a fair coin yet.  
你不會因此改變這是一枚公正硬幣的信念    
  
20  
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.490  
You would want to see more evidence.  
你會想要再做更多試驗    
    
21  
00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.010  
Now  
data is possible in this Bayesian sense.  
貝氏統計能結合個人信念與事實證據    
  
22  
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.260  
It's not possible when you  
just calculate P-values.  
這是p值做不到的功能    
  
23  
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.136  
Remember that the P-value expresses  
the probability of the data or  
請記住p值表達以虛無假設為真的前提，不論手上資料是否極端，確實存在的程度    
  
24  
00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:34.678  
more extreme data assuming that  
the null hypothesis is true.  
請記住p值表達以虛無假設為真的前提，不論手上資料是否極端，確實存在的程度    
  
25  
00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:38.544  
And some people say  
actually not what you want to know.  
有人認為p值不能代表研究者想要得到的最終解答    
    
26  
00:01:38.544 --> 00:01:42.727  
What you want to know is the probability  
that the null hypothesis is true  
研究者要追求的是根據手上資料，虛無假設確實存在的程度    
  
27  
00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:45.092  
given some data that you have collected.  
研究者要追求的是根據手上資料，虛無假設確實存在的程度    
  
28  
00:01:45.092 --> 00:01:47.077  
And this is a posterior probability.  
這就是事後機率(posterior probability)  
  
29  
00:01:47.077 --> 00:01:50.699  
Given that you've collected some data  
maybe some prior beliefs that you have.  
根據手上的資料，加上已存在研究者腦中的信念    
  
30  
00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:53.532  
What is now the probability  
that the null hypothesis or  
能不能獲得虛無假設或對立假設為真的機率?  
  
31  
00:01:53.532 --> 00:01:56.240  
the alternative hypothesis is true?  
能不能獲得虛無假設或對立假設為真的機率?  
  
32  
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.090  
So Bayesian statistics allows  
you to express this probability.  
貝氏統計正是用來計算事後機率    
  
33  
00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.630  
It works quite straightforward.  
貝氏統計的原則很簡單    
  
34  
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.890  
You have some prior belief  
you have some data.  
把腦中的事前信念加上手上的資料    
  
35  
00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.110  
You combine these into a posterior belief.  
就能獲得目前證據的事後機率    
    
36  
00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.935  
We can calculate posterior odds that  
the alternative hypothesis is true given  
根據手上資料計算的事後機率比(posterior odds)    
可以比較對立假設為真與虛無假設為真的程度    
  
37  
00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:15.535  
the data  
根據手上資料計算的事後機率比(posterior odds)    
可以比較對立假設為真與虛無假設為真的程度    
  
38  
00:02:15.535 --> 00:02:19.884  
compared to the probability that the null  
hypothesis is true given the data.  
根據手上資料計算的事後機率比(posterior odds)    
可以比較對立假設為真與虛無假設為真的程度    
  
39  
00:02:19.884 --> 00:02:25.499  
This is a very useful way to split apart  
these different aspects of the formula.  
對照公式的每個部分與貝氏原則可以看到    
  
40  
00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:31.090  
So the posterior equals  
the likelihood ratio times the prior.  
事後機率就是似然性比與事前信念的乘積    
  
41  
00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.224  
So  
this likelihood ratio  
公式裡的似然性比    
  
42  
00:02:33.224 --> 00:02:35.138  
that we discussed in a previous lecture  
就是前一講介紹的重點    
  
43  
00:02:35.138 --> 00:02:38.818  
is an essential part of the probability  
calculations in Bayesian statistics.  
可以看到似然性比是計算事後機率的重要成份    
  
44  
00:02:38.818 --> 00:02:42.672  
But it's also combined with this prior  
so how can we do this?  
不過要結合事前機率，那麼要怎麼知道事前機率呢？  
    
45  
00:02:42.672 --> 00:02:47.050  
We have to come up with  
a prior distribution.  
在此介紹一種事前機率分配    
  
46  
00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.670  
In the case of binomial probabilities  
a beta distribution is used.  
所謂的beta分配是用在資料有二項性質的狀況    
  
47  
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.450  
The beta prior is determined by two  
parameters which are referred to as  
beta事前分配由alpha與beta兩種參數決定    
  
48  
00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.200  
alpha and beta.  
beta事前分配由alpha與beta兩種參數決定    
  
49  
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.580  
Now this can get a little confusing  
because we already talked about alphas and  
在這裡你也許會和之前提過代表型一與型二錯誤率的alpha與beta搞混    
  
50  
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.079  
betas as type one errors and  
type two errors.  
在這裡你也許會和之前提過代表型一與型二錯誤率的alpha與beta搞混    
  
51  
00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.840  
Regrettably  
are not very creative when it comes to  
這是因為統計學家使用希臘字母做統計符號的創意不夠所致    
  
52  
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.280  
thinking up greek letters that they  
want to use for their statistics.  
這是因為統計學家使用希臘字母做統計符號的創意不夠所致    
  
53  
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.530  
So there are some double  
use in the literature  
有時一種符號在同一篇論文裡有很多意思    
  
54  
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.320  
this is one of these examples.  
beta分配就是一個例子    
  
55  
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.820  
The beta prior is determined by alpha and  
beta.  
這裡的alpha與beta只是決定beta分配的性質    
  
56  
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.010  
These are just two numbers that have  
nothing to do with error rates whatsoever.  
與任何形式的錯誤率全無關係    
    
57  
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.670  
Let's take a look a different  
versions of prior distributions.  
來看看幾種不同的beta事前分配    
  
58  
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.761  
If we set the alpha and  
the beta in the beta probability to 1  
這道beta分配的alpha與beta都是1    
  
59  
00:03:32.761 --> 00:03:35.659  
we see that we got  
the perfectly flat line.  
呈現出一條完美的水平線    
  
60  
00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.259  
This means that every value  
of theta which is plotted on  
也就是說得到範圍內任一統計值(theta)的機率都是相等的    
  
61  
00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:43.659  
the horizontal axis is equally likely.  
也就是說得到範圍內任一統計值(theta)的機率都是相等的    
  
62  
00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:46.100  
So we don't have any expectations and  
這種分配符合不預期特定結果的信念    
  
63  
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.160  
we say anything that  
might happen is possible.  
可以說任何結果都有可能發生    
  
64  
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.570  
Now in the case of a coin flip  
在投擲硬幣的例子裡    
  
65  
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.920  
you might not be convinced that  
this is what's most likely.  
就是代表不會有經常觀察到某種結果的信念    
  
66  
00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.110  
In the case of flipping a coin  
you can have a lot of different beliefs.  
當然對於硬幣是否公正的信念可以因人而異    
    
67  
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.000  
One of them is the belief that this  
is a coin that always comes up heads.  
其中一種信念是想信這枚硬幣永遠擲出正面朝上    
  
68  
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.990  
If you have a very strong belief that this  
is the case  
若你相信如此，這道beta分配完美體現你的想法    
  
69  
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:12.665  
You think that it will  
be heads almost always  
雖然少數情況會出現不同的結果(theta接近0)，多數情況都會預期正面朝上(theta接近1)    
  
70  
00:04:12.665 --> 00:04:17.341  
although you are willing to give at least  
some probability of different values.  
雖然少數情況會出現不同的結果(theta接近0)，多數情況都會預期正面朝上(theta接近1)    
  
71  
00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:21.183  
You might also think that this  
is a perfectly fair coin  
你也可能根據多數硬幣是公正的，而相信眼前這一枚也是    
  
72  
00:04:21.183 --> 00:04:23.320  
most coins are fair after all.  
你也可能根據多數硬幣是公正的，而相信眼前這一枚也是    
  
73  
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.670  
So you think that this coin should  
come up heads 50% of the time.  
你認為每次擲出正面的機率是50%    
  
74  
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.300  
You have a very strong belief in this.  
把這樣的信念轉換成beta分配      
  
75  
00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.210  
And it's illustrated in this graph  
where there's a very high peak  
分配就是theta等於0.5之處有一個高峰    
  
76  
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.810  
at 0.5 on the theta.  
分配就是theta等於0.5之處有一個高峰    
  
77  
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.450  
But you're also willing to allow for  
some variation.  
當然你也可以認為存在其它可能的結果    
  
78  
00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.580  
It might be that the coin  
is not perfectly fair.  
因為一些原因，眼前這枚硬幣並不公正    
  
79  
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.080  
It might have been used and  
it might be an old coin and  
也許被反覆使用，也許太舊了    
  
80  
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.249  
might come up heads a little bit  
more often or a little less often.  
使得擲出正面的次數多一些    
    
81  
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:55.030  
Now let's combine our prior belief  
whatever it is  
來看看怎樣把這些代表事前信念的beta分配    
  
82  
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.230  
with the data that we've observed.  
與觀察獲得的資料結合在一起吧    
  
83  
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.810  
So we have beta prior distribution  
and we have the likelihood function  
現在有beta分配代表事前機率  
手上資料可轉換成似然性函數    
  
84  
00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.030  
and we can quite easily combine  
these into a posterior distribution.  
結合兩者就能立刻獲得事後機率分配    
    
85  
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.840  
The posterior is also a beta distribution  
with an alpha and a beta value.  
事後機率分配也是一道有alpha與beta值的beta分配    
  
86  
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.650  
And the alpha and  
the beta are determined simply by  
要計算事後分配的alpha和beta，只要把事前的參數加上似然性函數估計的參數，再減去1就行了    
  
87  
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.640  
adding the alpha of the prior to the alpha  
of the likelihood function minus 1.  
要計算事後分配的alpha和beta，只要把事前的參數加上似然性函數估計的參數，再減去1就行了    
  
88  
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.470  
The same is true for the beta.  
要計算事後分配的alpha和beta，只要把事前的參數加上似然性函數估計的參數，再減去1就行了    
  
89  
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.190  
The beta of the prior  
distribution added to the beta  
要計算事後分配的alpha和beta，只要把事前的參數加上似然性函數估計的參數，再減去1就行了    
  
90  
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.964  
of the likelihood distribution minus 1.  
要計算事後分配的alpha和beta，只要把事前的參數加上似然性函數估計的參數，再減去1就行了    
    
91  
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.710  
Let's see how this works.  
來看實際的例子    
  
92  
00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.760  
In this case we have a prior distribution  
that's uninformative  
這道事前分配是無資訊的(uninfomative)，是最容易理解的情況    
  
93  
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.972  
So this is a prior before  
we collect some data.  
代表未收集資料前認定任何結果發生的機率都相等    
    
94  
00:05:40.972 --> 00:05:44.600  
And now we collect some data and  
we have a likelihood function.  
收集資料後有了這道似然性函數(藍色虛線)  
  
95  
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.510  
In this case we flip the coin ten times.  
這道函數表示投了硬幣十次    
  
96  
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.810  
Six out of the ten times  
we observed heads.  
其中六次看到正面朝上    
  
97  
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.550  
So that's expressed by this  
likelihood function and  
所以看到高峰出現在theta等於6    
  
98  
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.160  
now we will combine these two functions  
into a posterior distribution.  
接著把兩道分配結合在一起，就會看到事後分配的模樣    
    
99  
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.600  
You now see a black line that falls  
exactly on top of the likelihood function.  
事後分配的黑線與似然性函數的曲線完美疊合    
  
100  
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.730  
This is what's meant with  
an uninformative prior.  
這是因為事前分配是無資訊的      
  
101  
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.423  
Everything was equally likely beforehand  
and  
事前認為任何結果都有可能    
  
102  
00:06:10.423 --> 00:06:13.123  
it doesn't influence our  
judgments in any way.  
這樣的信念不影響對結果的判斷    
  
103  
00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:16.214  
We just believe whatever we  
have observed exactly the same.  
所以事後分配與實際資料一致    
  
104  
00:06:16.214 --> 00:06:19.800  
So the prior does not influence  
the posterior distribution in any way.  
因此這個例子事前信念毫不影響事後分配  
  
105  
00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.630  
Let's take another example  
where this is the case  
接著來看另一個事前信念確實影響事後分配的例子    
  
106  
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.680  
where the prior does influence  
the posterior distribution.  
接著來看另一個事前信念確實影響事後分配的例子    
  
107  
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.570  
Here we have some belief that  
the coin is probably fair.  
這道事前分配表示硬幣是公正的    
  
108  
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.680  
We think that values around 0.5  
are somewhat more likely but  
設定統計值在0.5多少表達這樣的信念  
  
109  
00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:39.220  
we don't have a very strong  
conviction about this.  
不過分配的變異表示對此信念不會過度堅持    
    
110  
00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:42.600  
We again observe the same data.  
獲得的資料也是10次之中擲出6次正面  
  
111  
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.450  
We flip the coin ten times  
six out of ten the coin lands heads.  
獲得的資料也是10次之中擲出6次正面  
  
112  
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.170  
So this is exactly the same  
likelihood function that we had in  
所以得到與前一個例子同樣的似然性函數    
  
113  
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.770  
the previous example but  
we have a slightly different prior.  
只是擁有不大相同的事前信念      
  
114  
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.030  
Combining our prior belief with  
the observed data yields a posterior  
兩者結合之後就能得到一道新的事後機率分配    
  
115  
00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.040  
distribution that no longer falls exactly  
on top of the likelihood function.  
不過這道分配和似然性函數完全不疊合    
  
116  
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.250  
Indeed we see that the posterior  
這道事後機率分配稍微偏向事前信念的beta分配    
  
117  
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:10.720  
is slightly shrinking towards  
the prior belief that we held.  
這道事後機率分配稍微偏向事前信念的beta分配    
  
118  
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.850  
Now  
the posterior distribution  
有了事前機率分配與事後率分配    
  
119  
00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.170  
we can calculate something  
that's known as a Bayes factor.  
就能計算貝氏因子(Bayes Factor)  
  
120  
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:26.590  
The Bayes factor is the relative evidence  
for one model compared to another model.  
貝式因子表示手上證據支持兩種模型的相對程度    
  
121  
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.239  
Now compare this to likelihood ratios.  
現在我們用似然性比值計算支持程度    
  
122  
00:07:30.239 --> 00:07:33.345  
In a likelihood ratio we only  
have one distribution and  
透過這道似然性函數，比較兩個統計值的似然性  
  
123  
00:07:33.345 --> 00:07:37.749  
we're comparing two different values  
of theta on the likelihood function.  
透過這道似然性函數，比較兩個統計值的似然性  
  
124  
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:41.600  
But here we'll use the likelihood  
from the prior distribution and  
現在要用這道函數計算事前分配的似然性  
  
125  
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.900  
compare it to the likelihood  
of the posterior distribution.  
與事後分配的似然性相互比較    
  
126  
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:46.430  
Let's take a look.  
接著看要怎麼做    
  
127  
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.450  
We have data from 20 coin flips.  
現在手上有擲20枚硬幣的資料    
  
128  
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.960  
They came up heads 10 times.  
其中10次正面朝上    
  
129  
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:56.670  
Let's take a look at two different priors.  
對此有兩種事前信念    
  
130  
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:01.581  
Either a Beta prior of (1  
means it's completely uninformative  
一種是不知這枚硬幣公正與否的均勻分配beta(1  
  
131  
00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:02.817  
the uniform prior.  
一種是不知這枚硬幣公正與否的均勻分配beta(1  
  
132  
00:08:02.817 --> 00:08:05.517  
But we can also compare  
it to a Beta of (4  
另一種是認為這是枚公正硬幣的beta(4  
  
133  
00:08:05.517 --> 00:08:09.343  
4) where we have some expectation  
that this is a fair coin.  
另一種是認為這是枚公正硬幣的beta(4  
  
134  
00:08:09.343 --> 00:08:13.910  
Now  
see the prior distribution in  
這張圖中代表事前分配的灰色線正是均勻分佈    
  
135  
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.810  
the gray line that's  
uniformly distributed.  
這張圖中代表事前分配的灰色線正是均勻分佈    
  
136  
00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.480  
We don't have very strong  
prior beliefs in this case.  
這表示沒有對特定結果存在強烈信念    
  
137  
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.510  
Everything is equally likely.  
任何結果都可以接受    
  
138  
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:26.010  
Then we've collected some data  
now we have a posterior distribution  
收集資料後得到的事後分配  
  
139  
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:28.859  
which in this case falls exactly  
on top of the likelihood function.  
與由此獲得的似然性函數疊合    
  
140  
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.770  
You can see that there is a relative  
difference of the likelihood of  
這裡可以看到兩個分配在任意一點的似然性差異    
  
141  
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:36.770  
both of these functions  
at specific points.  
這裡可以看到兩個分配在任意一點的似然性差異    
  
142  
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.970  
Now  
hypothesis that we're interested in.  
現在必須要決定真正有興趣的假設是針對那一個值    
  
143  
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:43.600  
Let's say that we want to know  
whether this is a fair coin or not.  
比方說要知道這枚硬幣是否公正  
  
144  
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:48.262  
So in this case  
the hypothesis that theta is 0.5.  
要測試這個假設就要看theta為0.5的情況    
  
145  
00:08:48.262 --> 00:08:53.006  
We can compare the prior distribution with  
the posterior distribution to see how  
比較事前與事後分配的差異可以了解收集的資料改變信念的程度    
  
146  
00:08:53.006 --> 00:08:56.156  
much our belief has changed  
by collecting some data.  
比較事前與事後分配的差異可以了解收集的資料改變信念的程度    
  
147  
00:08:56.156 --> 00:09:01.830  
So the prior at 0.5 was much lower  
than the posterior is at 0.5.  
這張圖明顯表示在0.5的事前分配似然性低於事後分配  
  
148  
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:06.149  
And the ratio of these two points is 3.7.  
得到的似然性比值是3.7  
  
149  
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:13.190  
This is a slightly different version  
where we only have a different prior.  
這張圖的事前分配是beta(4  
  
150  
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:17.910  
We've observed exactly the same data but  
the prior now is slightly more informed.  
雖然資料也是相同的，但是這個事前分配包含有關這枚硬幣的信念    
  
151  
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:20.400  
We already expected that  
this coin would be fair.  
這個情況已事先預期這是枚公正硬幣    
  
152  
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.760  
We collect the same amount of data and  
we again see that for  
以同樣的資料計算兩個分配的似然性    
  
153  
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.160  
the theta of 0.5 the hypothesis  
that this is a fair coin.  
並以theta是0.5的似然性比檢測假設    
  
154  
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.860  
Our belief in the hypothesis that  
the coin is fair has increased.  
事後分配表示對於硬幣是公正的信念增加了    
  
155  
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.070  
But because we already  
had quite a strong prior  
不過因為事前先有特定的預期    
  
156  
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:38.699  
the data only increases  
our belief with 1.9.  
增加的比值只有1.9    
  
157  
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.786  
So after looking at the data  
儘管資料呈現的似然性函數是相同的    
  
158  
00:09:43.786 --> 00:09:49.257  
the hypothesis that the theta  
is 0.5 has become either 1.91 or  
theta為0.5的似然性比是1.91還是3.70  
  
159  
00:09:49.257 --> 00:09:54.460  
3.70 times more likely  
depending on the prior that we had.  
完全取決於接受那種事前信念    
  
160  
00:09:55.620 --> 00:10:01.148  
So we can see how base vectors tell you  
something about the increased evidence or  
由此可以了解貝氏因子如何告訴你增加的證據力有多少    
  
161  
00:10:01.148 --> 00:10:06.100  
the belief that you have about  
the specific hypothesis compared to your  
或者根據事前與事後分配，推估證據比較支持那個假設    
  
162  
00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:07.932  
prior and the posterior.  
或者根據事前與事後分配，推估證據比較支持那個假設    
  
163  
00:10:07.932 --> 00:10:12.039  
Now we can also look at Bayesian  
statistics not from a hypothesis testing  
除了由假設檢定的角度了解貝氏統計如何根據事前與事後分配測試假設    
  
164  
00:10:12.039 --> 00:10:16.233  
viewpoint where you test the hypothesis  
and the prior and the posterior.  
除了由假設檢定的角度了解貝氏統計如何根據事前與事後分配測試假設    
  
165  
00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:20.990  
But we just want to estimate which  
values do we think is most likely.  
也可以估計想測量的真實數值    
  
166  
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.410  
So this is not Bayesian hypothesis  
testing  
這樣的方法就叫做貝氏估計      
  
167  
00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.960  
We also use the posterior  
distribution to estimate.  
估計同樣需要事後分配    
  
168  
00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:33.990  
So instead of testing two different  
models  
不同於用事前與事後分配檢驗兩種模型    
  
169  
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:38.090  
we will use the posterior just  
to estimate plausible values.  
現在要用事後分配估計最可信的數值    
  
170  
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:43.850  
Which values do you believe are most  
likely based on your prior belief and  
要怎樣根據事前信念與觀察到的資料估計數值呢?  
  
171  
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:44.910  
the data you have observed?  
要怎樣根據事前信念與觀察到的資料估計數值呢?  
  
172  
00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:53.510  
In this graph we again see a prior  
distribution and a posterior distribution.  
這張圖也有之前看過的事前與事後機率分配    
  
173  
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:57.320  
And in this case  
an uninformative prior  
因為事前分配是無資訊的  
  
174  
00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.770  
the posterior fall exactly  
on top of each other.  
似然性函數與事後分配再一次完美疊合    
  
175  
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:05.580  
We can calculate the mean of the posterior  
distribution and we can calculate what  
我們可以計算事後分配的平均值    
  
176  
00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.400  
in Bayesian statistics  
is known as 95% credible interval.  
以及貝氏統計稱呼的95%可信區間(credible interval)    
  
177  
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:16.260  
A credible interval contains 95% of  
the values that you find most plausible.  
可信區間涵蓋的數值有95%的可能性是真實的      
  
178  
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.530  
So this is an expression of your belief.  
也就是你相信為真的數值範圍      
  
179  
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:24.620  
Which values do you believe are most  
likely given your prior and  
範圍中那些數值是你最相信的    
全由事前信念與手上資料決定    
  
180  
00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:25.410  
the observed data?  
範圍中那些數值是你最相信的    
全由事前信念與手上資料決定    
  
181  
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:30.230  
Now  
have used an uninformative prior  
這個例子裡的事前信念是無資訊的    
  
182  
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:34.820  
you can see that the likelihood function  
is basically everything that matters.  
所以由手上資料構成的似然性函數    
  
183  
00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.810  
The posterior distribution is  
completely determined by the data.  
決定事後分配的模樣    
  
184  
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:45.860  
And this is a situation where the 95%  
credible interval in Bayesian statistics  
只有這種狀況才會看到貝氏統計的可信區間    
  
185  
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:51.900  
exactly matches with the 95% confidence  
interval in frequentist statistics.  
與次數主義統計的信賴區間是完全一致的    
  
186  
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.040  
But that's not always the case.  
不過除非所有研究的事前信念都是無資訊的    
  
187  
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.890  
This is only true when we  
use an uninformative prior.  
這種狀況一輩子很難碰到幾次    
  
188  
00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:59.960  
Let's see how this changes when  
we use a more informative prior.  
接著來看看有資訊的事前信念會有什麼結果    
    
189  
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.650  
Now let's take a look at this  
slightly different situation.  
這張圖呈現另一種狀況的分析結果    
  
190  
00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:09.530  
Rather extreme example where we had  
a very strong prior belief that  
這個狀況的事前信念是相信這枚硬幣有2/3的機會擲出正面    
  
191  
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:15.238  
the coin would come up heads about  
two thirds of the time  
這個狀況的事前信念是相信這枚硬幣有2/3的機會擲出正面    
  
192  
00:12:15.238 --> 00:12:18.530  
You can see the grey distribution  
peaking at this point  
所以灰色的事前分配最高峰就在0.666  
  
193  
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:22.050  
this was our prior belief  
before we collected some data.  
表達收集資料前對硬幣的信念    
  
194  
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.833  
But then we collect data and we actually  
find a completely different pattern.  
但是收集的資料卻呈現與事前信念不同的模樣    
  
195  
00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:28.583  
We see that the coin came up  
heads about 40% of the time.  
投擲硬幣很多次之後    
  
196  
00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:30.748  
And we collected quite a lot of data  
得到的似然性函數最高點出現在0.4    
  
  
197  
00:12:30.748 --> 00:12:33.910  
the blue likelihood function  
is completely different.  
和事前分配完全不一樣    
  
198  
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:38.640  
We can also see that the black  
posterior distribution is now  
以黑色曲線標示的事後分配則落在兩者之間    
  
199  
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.990  
a little bit in between of  
both of these functions.  
以黑色曲線標示的事後分配則落在兩者之間    
  
200  
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:47.495  
So the data and the prior are merged  
into a posterior distribution.  
代表事前信念與手上資料融合的結果    
  
201  
00:12:47.495 --> 00:12:52.459  
And the 95% credible interval  
now contains values that no  
95%可信區間與95%信賴區間並無重疊    
  
202  
00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:56.656  
longer match within 95%  
confidence interval.  
95%可信區間與95%信賴區間並無重疊    
  
203  
00:12:56.656 --> 00:13:01.533  
A very strong prior has made it so  
that our believe in the most likely most  
有特定預期的事前信念讓可信區間的範圍明顯縮小    
  
204  
00:13:01.533 --> 00:13:05.700  
plausible values the values  
that we feel most confident in.  
有特定預期的事前信念讓可信區間的範圍明顯縮小    
  
205  
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.749  
Are no longer exactly matching  
up with the data  
也因為事前信念的影響    
  
206  
00:13:08.749 --> 00:13:12.090  
they're slightly influenced  
by the prior that we have.  
讓可信區間的範圍與資料不完全重合    
  
207  
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.790  
This also shows a strength  
of Bayesian statistics.  
這個例子表現了貝氏統計的能耐    
  
208  
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:20.160  
We had a prior belief  
quantified by putting a function on it  
透過事前信念能預期最合理的統計值    
  
209  
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.090  
and then we observed some data.  
再考慮收集的資料    
  
210  
00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.260  
And you can see that our  
belief can be changed.  
接著計算事後信念改變的程度    
  
211  
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.422  
In this case  
is still sort of halfway in between.  
這個例子的事後分配恰好落在中間    
  
212  
00:13:30.422 --> 00:13:35.171  
But if we collect enough data  
we should see that the posterior belief  
如果收集足夠的資料，就會看到事後分配相當接近似然性函數    
  
213  
00:13:35.171 --> 00:13:39.750  
becomes very  
very close to the likelihood function.  
如果收集足夠的資料，就會看到事後分配相當接近似然性函數    
  
214  
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:44.440  
So this shows that if we collect enough  
data  
收集更多資料之後，對於硬幣是否公正的信念會逐漸改變    
  
215  
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.253  
we can become convinced  
about something else.  
逐漸相信真實數值不同於事前信念    
  
216  
00:13:47.253 --> 00:13:49.576  
This is  
a very useful way to do science.  
這種推論方式非常適合科學    
  
217  
00:13:49.576 --> 00:13:53.349  
And  
between science and religion.  
也體現科學與宗教信仰的差異    
  
218  
00:13:53.349 --> 00:13:57.536  
In religion  
any option to update your belief.  
身為教徒者不可改變對教義的信念    
  
219  
00:13:57.536 --> 00:14:01.489  
But  
we have a very logical framework  
貝氏統計卻提供一套有邏輯的架構    
  
220  
00:14:01.489 --> 00:14:06.091  
where data can change our prior beliefs  
and lead to new posterior beliefs.  
能根據資料調整事前信念，邁向合理的事後信念    
  
221  
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:15.020  
So this 95% credible interval contains  
the values that you find most plausible.  
95%可信區間包括所有你能找到的最可能結果    
  
222  
00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:19.611  
It's all about expressing and quantifying  
your belief in specific values.  
以具體數值表現與計量最為可信的統計值    
    
223  
00:14:19.611 --> 00:14:24.004  
Now in this lecture we've seen how  
can you use Bayesian statistics to  
總結而言貝氏統計能量化你事先認定的合理數值  
依理論收集資料，再根據資料更新合理數值的信念  
  
224  
00:14:24.004 --> 00:14:27.186  
quantify your prior beliefs  
collect data  
總結而言貝氏統計能量化你事先認定的合理數值  
依理論收集資料，再根據資料更新合理數值的信念  
  
225  
00:14:27.186 --> 00:14:31.445  
then update your beliefs based on  
the data that you've observed.  
總結而言貝氏統計能量化你事先認定的合理數值  
依理論收集資料，再根據資料更新合理數值的信念
