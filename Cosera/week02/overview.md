How would you define ‘evidence’? It’s not an easy question! One answer is that evidence is necessarily relative. In Likelihood approaches (Lecture 2.1) and Bayesian statistics (Lecture 2.2), we see different ways of quantifying relative evidence. Bayesian statistics is also based on likelihoods, but in addition, allows you to incorporate prior information, if you have any. Even if you don’t want to use Bayesian statistics, it is important to at least learn how to take prior information into account less formally, as discussed in the lecture on Bayesian thinking (Lecture 2.3). You will get hands on experience calculating likelihood ratios in assignment 2.1, and Bayes factors and Bayesian estimation in assignment 2.2.

「證據」要怎麼定義呢？這問題可不容易！
其中一種解答是「證據是相對的」，像是似然性 (講演 2.1)以及貝氏統計 (講演 2.2)。貝氏統計以似然性為基礎，更納入了「先驗知識」的概念。不論你是否有意使用貝氏統計，學習如何考量先驗知識仍是很重要的；我會在講演2.3中討論貝氏思維(Bayesian thinking)。在本週的作業中，會讓你親手演算似然比(作業2.1)，以及貝氏因子、貝氏估計(作業2.2)。

Lecture 2.1

The go-to book about likelihoods is by Royall (but regrettably, it is quite expensive).

Royall, R. (1997). Statistical Evidence: A Likelihood Paradigm. London?; New York: Chapman and Hall/CRC.

He provides a summary here:

Royall, R. (2004). The likelihood paradigm for statistical evidence. The nature of scientific evidence. Statistical, philosophical, and empirical considerations. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois, 119-152.

A nice tutorial introduction is given by Blume:

Blume, J. D. (2002). Likelihood methods for measuring statistical evidence. Statistics in Medicine, 21(17), 2563-2599.

And an applied book-length treatment can be found in:

Pawitan, Y. (2001). In all likelihood: statistical modelling and inference using likelihood. Oxford?: New York: Clarendon Press?; Oxford University Press.

Lecture 2.2 and Lecture 2.3

A good introduction to Bayesian statistics for the social science is provides by Jackman (Chapter 2 is closely related to Assignment 2.2).

Jackman, S. (2009). Bayesian analysis for the social sciences. Chichester, U.K: Wiley.

An article highlighting some of the strengths of Bayesian statistics is provided by Wagenmakers and colleagues. It specifically discusses the studies by Daryl Bem on pre-cognition we have described, and also touches on the need to distinguish confirmatory and exploratory research (see Lecture 3.3):

Wagenmakers, E.-J., Wetzels, R., Borsboom, D., & van der Maas, H. l. (2011). Why Psychologists Must Change the Way They Analyze Their Data: The Case of Psi: Comment on Bem (2011). Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 100(3), 426-432.

Zoltan Dienes has an accessible introduction to how Bayes factors change the way you would make scientific inferences:

Dienes, Z. (2016). How Bayes factors change scientific practice. Journal of Mathematical Psychology. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249615000607

And a great tutorial handbook on Bayesian data analysis that focusses on Bayesian estimation instead of Bayesian hypothesis testing is written by Kruschke:

Kruschke, J. (2010). Doing Bayesian data analysis: A tutorial introduction with R. Academic Press.
