[似然值]

2
00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:12.830
In this lecture we will
talk about likelihoods.   
這段影片介紹的是似然值

3
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.700
Likelihoods are a way to express
the relative evidence for  
似然值是兩個假說間的相對證據

4
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.770
one hypothesis over another hypothesis.   
似然值是兩個假說間的相對證據

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.210
They can be very useful in themselves.   
似然值很有用

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.890
But they are also underlying
a lot of Bayesian statistics,   
至於藏身其中的貝氏統計學

7
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.100
as we'll see in later lectures.   
我們下次再談

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.018
A likelihood gives you the function
of a parameter given the data.      
似然值是資料參數的函數「L(θ)」


9
00:00:30.018 --> 00:00:33.900
So when you've observed some data, you
can pull up the accompanying likelihood   
從觀察資料中得出似然值函數

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.660
function and you can check how likely
each hypothesis that you might have is.   
以評估不同假說的可能性

11
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.480
In this example, we mainly focus on
the binomial likelihood function.   
以最簡化的情形，二項似然函數為例

12
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.920
This is the easiest situation.   
以最簡化的情形，二項似然函數為例


13
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.159
It's like flipping a coin and   
假設你擲硬幣數次

14
00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.500
then counting the number of
heads that you have observed.   
記下正面出現的次數

15
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.460
This is the binomial likelihood function.   
這就是二項似然函數了

16
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.220
I won't explain it in detail here, but   
在此我不說明細節   
而是當成作業

17
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.650
there's an accompanying assignment in
which we dive into the function and      
會請你以不同觀測值，計算出對應的似然值


18
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.620
calculate some likelihoods for different
of observations of number of heads.   
會請你以不同觀測值，計算出對應的似然值

19
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.100
For now, let's take a look at the
situation where we flip a coin ten times.   
讓我們瞧瞧擲硬幣10次的情形

20
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.720
Eight of these ten times we find
that the coin comes up heads.   
其中有8枚硬幣正面朝上

21
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.900
We can calculate the likelihood of theta,   
基於這些數據   
我們已經可以計算θ的似然值了

22
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.000
and theta in this case is a Greek letter
that explains the true hypotheses.   
但首先這裡的θ是什麼呢？   
(1)是個代表真實假說的希臘字母(讀音theta)

23
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.450
And in this case we might assume that the
true underlying number of heads that we   
(2)只要你擲夠多次硬幣，   
觀察到的正面硬幣枚數比值


24
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.820
will observe if we do this
in the long run is 0.8.   
(2)只要你擲夠多次硬幣，   
觀察到的正面硬幣枚數比值

25
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.233
So for the theta of 0.8, we can
calculate that the likelihood is 0.30.   
從θ=0.8得出   
似然值=0.30

26
00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:36.260
But we can also calculate the likelihoods
for all sorts of different hypotheses.    
除了θ=0.8的情形，還可以假設更多情形



27
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.400
Let's say that you have the idea that
the true value of the number of coin flips   
如果你認為只要你擲夠多次硬幣    
觀察到的正面硬幣枚數的機率為70%


28
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.490
in the long run is 70% or a theta of 0.7.      
或是稱作θ=0.8。你該怎麼計算它的似然值？

29
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.760
The likelihood for this being true,
based on the data that we have observed,   
切記似然值基於我們的觀測數據


30
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.880
eight out of ten coin
flips turned up heads.   
就是「擲10次硬幣出現8枚正面朝上」的情形


31
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.504
The likelihood of the true
population effect being 0.7 is 0.23.   
據此，θ=0.7時   
或然率=0.23


32
00:01:59.504 --> 00:02:02.200
The likelihood of a theta of 0.6 is 0.12.
θ=0.6時   
或然率=0.12

33
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.000
So you can see it becomes less and   
它離你的觀察值(θ=0.8)越遠

34
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.810
less likely the farther away
you go from the observed data.   
它的或然值也變得越小

35
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.380
Now these numbers are not very clear, so   
到此我們已稍微有了數感

36
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.060
let's take a look at
the likelihood function.   
接著來談談或然函數(likelihood function)吧

37
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.960
In this graph, you can see
the likelihood function plotted.   
這場圖所描繪的是或然函數

38
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.920
On the vertical dimension of this graph,
we have plotted the likelihood.   
縱軸，代表似然值   
橫軸，代表θ

39
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.840
And on the horizontal dimension,
we have plotted theta.   
縱軸，代表似然值   
橫軸，代表θ

40
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.494
All different versions
ranging from 0 to 1.
數值介於0到1之間   

41
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.880
So the range of 0 to 1 means that we
will either always observe heads or　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
不會出現「全是正面」或「毫無正面」的情形

42
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.330
we'll never observe heads.　　　　　　
不會出現「全是正面」或「毫無正面」的情形

43
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.100
Now based on the data we have collected,
we already know that　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
依據資料已知

44
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.350
it's not possible that we'll never observe
heads or we'll never observe tails.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
不可能從不出現正面或或反面


45
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.360
Because eight out of ten
turned out to be heads.
所以正面或反面必定出現


46
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.740
So we've observed both values.　　　　
沒有極值(全正面或全反面)的情形

47
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.740
So the extremes are not possible, and
you can see that the likelihood here is 0,　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
所以極值的似然值等於0

48
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.310
it's very low.　　　　　　　　　　　　　
所以極值的似然值等於0

49
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.240
The most likely true population parameter
of the number of coin flips based on　　　　　　　　　　　　
擲銅板的真母體參數值(θ)取決於數據

50
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.010
the data that we have is 0.8, because
this is exactly what we have observed.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
觀察數據得出θ=0.8

51
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.980
So this is the maximum likelihood.　　　
最大似然值便在θ=0.8時出現
(如圖)

52
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.270
Based on the data that
we have in our hands,　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
已知0.8是最可能的真母體參數值

53
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.430
we can see that 0.8 is the most
likely true population parameter.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
由我們手邊的資料得知0.8是最可能的真母體參數值

54
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.218
But some of the values just around
it are also still quite plausible.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
落在0.8附近的值也說得通

55
00:03:17.218 --> 00:03:21.570
So a value of 0.6 is still quite
probable in this case as well.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
例如θ=0.6也是蠻有可能的值

56
00:03:24.045 --> 00:03:27.355
These types of likelihood curves
were invented by Ronald Fisher,　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
費雪（Ronald Fisher)發明了這種似然曲線(likelihood curves)

57
00:03:27.355 --> 00:03:30.365
I already said he was a really,
really smart guy.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
他真的是個天才

58
00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:34.525
And he invented these likelihoods when he
was only 22 years old and actually a 3rd　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
年僅22歲的大三生就發明了似然值

59
00:03:34.525 --> 00:03:40.005
year undergraduate student, so this sort
of testifies to his genius, I would say.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
我認為這真的該歸為他的天分

60
00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:43.165
Sometimes I wonder what have I been doing
the last couple of years, definitely   
有時我捫心自問  
我在大學畢業前能發明統計學的基石嗎？

61
00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:46.970
not inventing something like this that's
a fundament of modern statistics.      
絕不可能

62
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.080
Now we can use the likelihood
under the null hypothesis and   
現在，我們可以用虛無假設的似然值

63
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.200
the likelihood under
the alternative hypothesis   
以及對立假設的似然值

64
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.530
to calculate something that's
known as the likelihood ratio.   
來計算似然值的比值(likelihood ratio)

65
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.810
So in the case of likelihood ratio,
we're taking the relative evidence for
所以當我們計算似然值的比值, 我們會採取

66
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.510
the one hypothesis, the null,
and the other hypothesis,
虛無假設和


67
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.620
the alternative, and we can calculate
the odds of one over the other.
對立假設的相對證據來計算他們個子的幾率比較

68
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.990
Let's look at our example,
where we had eight out of ten coin flips.
那我們來看我們的例子,我們翻轉了硬幣十分之八次

69
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.850
Now we need to compare two hypotheses, and
我們現在要比較兩個假設,和

70
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.620
you're free to choose any two
values of theta that you want.
你可以選擇任何兩個 theta θ 的數值

71
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.593
But one very logical value would be 50%,
0.5,
但是比較合理的數值是 50%, 0.5
	
72
00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:30.373
the hypothesis that this is
a perfectly balanced and fair coin.
我們假設這個硬幣是平衡和公平的

73
00:04:30.373 --> 00:04:35.890
So this is the value that's plotted
at 0.5 on the horizontal axis.
所以這個數值落在X軸的0.5上

74
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.610
And you can compare this with any
hypothesis you had in advance.
並且你可以用這個來比較之前有的假設

75
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.280
The alternative hypothesis I've
chosen here is the value 0.8.
我選擇的對立假設數值是0.8

76
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.730
This happens to be exactly the value
that we've observed in the data.
這個數值正是我們在數據中觀察到的

77
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.010
Eight out of ten coin flips.
十分之八次的硬幣翻轉

78
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.863
Now we're comparing this alternative
hypothesis that a true population
現在我們要比較這個對立假設,假設一個真正的母群體

79
00:04:52.863 --> 00:04:54.050
parameter is 0.8.
參數是0.8

80
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.097
So 80% of the time this coin
will come up heads, and
所以十分之八次這個硬幣將會翻到頭

81
00:04:57.097 --> 00:05:00.756
we'll compare it to the null hypothesis,
the value of 0.5,
我們將這個對立假設跟虛無假設比較,用的數值是0.5

82
00:05:00.756 --> 00:05:03.970
the idea that this is
a perfectly balanced, fair coin.
我們的概念是這個硬幣是平衡和公平

83
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.190
Now we can already see in the graph
that the likelihood is much
現在我們可以看到似然值在圖表

84
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.170
higher at 0.8 than it is at 0.5.
在0.8比在0.5還高

85
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.030
But what we want to know is,
how much more likely?
但是我們想知道的是,有多少可能性?

86
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.300
And the likelihood ratio
gives us an idea of this.
似然值能給我們這個答案.

87
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.769
It's basically dividing the likelihood
at 0.8 by the likelihood at 0.5.
基本上只要把0.8的似然值除以0.5的似然值

88
00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:23.270
And in this case, this ratio is 6.87.
得到的比率是 6.87.

89
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.173
So it's quite more likely that
the true population parameter is
所以很有可能真正的母群體參數

90
00:05:28.173 --> 00:05:33.269
0.8 compared to the ID that
the population parameters 0.5.
是0.8相對於ID的母群體參數0.5
 
91
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:38.390
Now we can test any values that we want.
現在我們可以測試任何我們想要的數值

92
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.910
Let say that in advance we still had
the same alternative hypothesis,
讓我們提前說，我們還是有相同的對立假設

93
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.980
that this was a coin that would
come up heads 80% of the time.
這個硬幣十分之八次會翻到頭

94
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.850
We still compare it to the probability
that this is a fair coin.
我們仍然將其與概率進行比較這是一個公平的硬幣

95
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.000
So these two hypotheses are being
compared, but now we have observed data
所以這兩個假設是在比較了，但現在我們觀察了數據

96
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.700
where the coin comes up heads
four times out of ten flips.
硬幣十分之四次會翻到頭

97
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.263
So we can see the shape of the likelihood
function is very different, and
所以我們可以看到似然值的函數形狀
是非常不同的，而且
	
98
00:06:02.263 --> 00:06:04.803
in this case of course,
based on the observed data,
從觀察的數據

99
00:06:04.803 --> 00:06:06.857
the likelihood of 0.4 is most likely.
0.4的可能性最高

100
00:06:06.857 --> 00:06:12.002
We can still compare the ratio of
the likelihoods at 0.5 and 0.8,
我們仍然可以比較0.5和0.8的可能性比率

101
00:06:12.002 --> 00:06:17.960
and now we see that the value of 0.5 is
much more likely than the value at 0.8.
現在我們看到0.5的數值是
比0.8的數值更有可能

102
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.930
So the hypothesis that this is a fair
coin is now much more likely than
所以我們的假設這是一個公平的硬幣

103
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.220
the hypothesis that this
is an unfair coin, and
會比這是一個不公平的
硬幣的假設和


104
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.039
that the true population parameter is 0.8.
真正的母群體參數是0.8更有可能

105
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.800
Now when you calculate likelihood ratios,
there are two cutoffs of 8 and
當你計算似然值的比值，
有兩個截止值為8和32

106
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.540
32 of these likelihood ratios which
are considered either moderately strong
被認為是中等強度證據

107
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.150
evidence or strong evidence.
或強度證據

108
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.450
So in the previous examples, we could see
that in the first case, we had not yet
所以在前面的例子中，我們可以看到
在第一種情況下，我們還沒有

109
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.190
moderately strong evidence for
the difference in the hypotheses.
中等強度證據給假設的差異

110
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.760
In the latter case, when we observed four
out of ten flips coming up heads, we can
在後一種情況下，當我們觀察到硬幣十分之四次會翻到頭

111
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.840
see that this was very strong evidence for
the fair coin hypothesis compared to
我們可以看到，這是非常有力的證據給
公平的硬幣假設,相比

112
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.250
the alternative, that this was a coin
with 0.8 coin flips coming up heads.
對立假設這是一個硬幣有0.8個硬幣翻轉頭

113
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.000
So you see that likelihoods
are relative evidence for
所以你看到似然值
是相對證據給

114
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.790
the alternative hypothesis
compared to the null hypothesis.
對立假設相比於虛無假設

115
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.660
It's important to realize that both of
these hypotheses might be quite unlikely.
重要的是要意識到這些假設都不太可能

116
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.649
Let's look at an example.
我們來看一個例子

117
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.220
Now here we flip the coin 100 times, and
現在這裡我們翻轉硬幣100次，和

118
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.210
50 out of the 100 times,
the coin came up heads.
100次中有50次，
硬幣翻到頭

119
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.460
Now, we are comparing two hypotheses here,
the one being that the true population
現在我們在這裡比較兩個假設，
一個是真正的母群體

120
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:41.520
parameter is 30% heads in the long run,
so a theta of 0.3.
參數長遠來說是30％頭, 所以θ為0.3

121
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.890
The alternative hypothesis is that
the true population parameter is at
對立假設是真正的母群體參數是在

122
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.620
theta of 0.8, so
we'll see 80% heads in the long run.
θ為0.8, 所以從長遠來看，我們會看到80％是頭

123
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.593
When we compare these two
hypotheses against each other,
當我們比較這兩個假設

124
00:07:54.593 --> 00:08:00.222
we can see that the hypothesis that true
population parameter is 0.3 is massively
我們可以看出假設真正的母群體參數是0.3是

125
00:08:00.222 --> 00:08:05.547
more likely than the likelihood that
the true population parameter is 0.8.
比真正的母群體參數是0.8更有可能

126
00:08:05.547 --> 00:08:09.330
And we find a ridiculously
high likelihood ratio.
和我們發現一個很高的似然值比值

127
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.974
However, we can also see that
both these hypotheses are wrong.
不過，我們也可以看到
這兩個假設都是錯誤的

128
00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:17.487
So even though the relative evidence for
the one hypothesis compare to the other
所以即使相對證據對於一個假設與另一個相比

129
00:08:17.487 --> 00:08:22.471
hypothesis is extremely convincing, we
didn't find the true population parameter,
非常有說服力, 我們沒有找到真正的母群體參數

130
00:08:22.471 --> 00:08:24.981
which is actually just 0.5 in this case.
在這種情況下其實只有0.5

131
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:28.485
So it's important to keep in mind that
likelihood ratios are relative evidence.
所以重要的是要記住
似然值比值是相對證據

132
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:36.340
Now we can compare the likelihood under
the null hypothesis of a theta of 0.05 and
現在我們可以比較虛無假設
的似然值, θ的零假設為0.05和

133
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:42.237
an alternative hypothesis of 0.8.
0.8的對立假設

134
00:08:42.237 --> 00:08:45.070
Now one way in which you can think about
現在你可以考慮一個方法

135
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:50.030
applying these likelihood ratios is when
you think about the outcomes of studies.
來應用這些似然值比值當你考慮研究的結果

136
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.030
Now, if you perform a study,
it's sort of like a coin flip.
現在，如果你進行一項研究，
它有點像一個硬幣翻轉

137
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.600
You can either find a statistically
significant result, or not.
你可以或不可以找到統計
重要的結果

138
00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.600
So this is one of two options,
and it's a binomial probability.
所以這是兩個選擇之一，
這是二項概率

139
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.210
So how often will you find
a significant result, and
所以你多常會找到一個重要的結果和

140
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.530
how often will you find
a non-significant result?
多常會找到一個不重要的結果？

141
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.330
Well it depends on whether
the null hypothesis is true or
那取決於是否
虛無假設是真的或

142
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.970
the alternative hypothesis is true.
對立假設是真的

143
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.182
When the null hypothesis is true,
we know that you'll find
當虛無假設為真時，
我們知道你會發現

144
00:09:14.182 --> 00:09:18.825
a significant result that equals your
alpha level, which is typically 0.05%.
一個重要的結果等於你的
α程度，通常為0.05％

145 
00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:22.700
So this is a very good null hypothesis
in these likelihood ratios.
所以這是一個非常好的虛無假設
在這些似然值比值

146
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.780
We can compare this with the probability
of finding significant results when
我們可以將其與概率進行比較
找到重要的結果

147
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.760
there is a true effect.
當有真正的效果

148
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.640
And in this case, this probability
depends on the statistical
在這種情況下，這種概率
取決於統計
149
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.900
power that you have in your test.
力量在你的測試中

150
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.183
Let's for now put it at 0.8, so
讓我們現在把它放在0.8，所以

151
00:09:35.183 --> 00:09:40.330
80% of the time you'll find a significant
result because you had 80% power.
80％的時間你會發現一個重要的結果
因為你有80％的功率

152
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.400
Now we can use the likelihood function
to compare the probability that we have
現在我們可以使用似然值函數來
比較我們的概率

153
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.870
observed a significant result
under the null hypothesis, and
觀察到顯著的結果
在虛無假設下，和

154
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.580
compare it with
the alternative hypothesis.
與之比較對立假設

155
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.998
Let's say that we perform
three studies in a row.
讓我們說我們連續做了三次研究。

156
00:09:56.998 --> 00:09:59.980
Now there are a number of outcomes
that could happen, of course.
當然,現在有一些結果可能會發生。

157
00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.530
None of these studies
could come up significant.
這些研究都沒有可能會出現重要的

158
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.630
You could find only one
significant effect, or two.
你只能找到一個重要的效果，或兩個

159
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.300
Or, if you're really lucky, three
significant results out of three studies.
或者，如果你真的很幸運，三個研究結果都是重要的

160
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.760
Now let's calculate
the likelihood of finding two
現在我們來計算找到三分之二

161
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.350
out of three significant results.
重要結果的似然值

162
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.900
When the null hypothesis is true,
this is pretty straightforward.
當虛無假設為真時，這很直白

163
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:25.440
The probability of finding a significant
effect when there's no true effect
找到重要效果的概率當沒有真正的效果

164
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.200
is the alpha level, so
this is 0.05% of the time.
是alpha水準，所以這是0.05％的時間。

165
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.530
We multiply it by two significant studies.
我們乘以兩個重要的研究

166
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.652
So 5% times 5%.
所以5％乘5％

167
00:10:35.652 --> 00:10:40.270
And then we multiply it by the probability
of finding no significant effect.
然後我們乘以找到無明顯影響的概率

168
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.500
Well, if we have a 5% alpha level,
then the probability of finding
那麼，如果我們有5％的alpha水準，
那麼找到

169
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.010
no significant effect, if there's
no true effect, is actually 95%.
無明顯影響的概率,如果有沒有真正的效果,
其實是95％

170
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.934
So if you multiply these probabilities,
所以如果你乘以這些概率，

171
00:10:50.934 --> 00:10:57.108
5% times 5% times 95%,
we get the value of 0.0024.
5％乘5％乘95％
我們得到的值為0.0024。

172
00:10:57.108 --> 00:11:01.339
All right, so what happens if there
is a true effect to be observed, and
好的，所以如果有一個要觀察的真正效果
的話會發生什麼事，和

173
00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:04.174
we find two out of three
significant findings?
我們發現三分之二的
重要發現？

174
00:11:04.174 --> 00:11:07.150
Now let's assume that we have 80% power.
現在我們假設我們有80％的power

175
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.430
You never really know, but
你真的不知道，但是

176
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.450
you can check different levels of power in
the likelihood function when it's plotted.
您可以檢查不同級別的power在
繪製的似然函數

177
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.200
But for now, let's take a look at 80%.
但是現在讓我們來看看80％。

178
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.860
So we find two significant results and
one nonsignificant result.
所以我們找到兩個重要的結果
一個不重要的結果

179
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.506
If the alternative hypothesis is true,
this equals an 80% probability of finding
如果對立假設是真的，
這等於80％的概率發現

180
00:11:24.506 --> 00:11:27.474
a significant result,
times an 80% probability of
一個重要的結果,乘以80％的概率

181
00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:32.200
finding a significant result, times a 20%
probability of making a type two error.
找到一個重要的結果, 乘以20％的概率造成類型二錯誤

182
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:38.558
And if we now multiply these
probabilities, we get 0.128.
如果我們現在乘與這些
概率，我們得到0.128

183
00:11:38.558 --> 00:11:42.745
So we can calculate the relative
likelihood of observing this data,
所以我們可以計算出觀察這些數據的相對似然值

184
00:11:42.745 --> 00:11:47.654
two out of three significant results,
when either the null hypothesis is true,
三分之二的重要成果，
當虛無假設為真時，

185
00:11:47.654 --> 00:11:50.130
or the alternative hypothesis is true.
或對立假設是真實的

186
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.540
Now based on these numbers, you can
already see that this outcome is much
現在基於這些數字, 你可以看到這個結果

187
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.660
more likely when there is a true effect
than when there is no true effect.
有真正的效果比沒有真正的效果更有可能

188
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.600
So, if we calculate likelihood ratio,
所以，如果我們計算似然值比值

189
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.070
we see that it's actually
54 times more likely that
我們看到它實際上是
54倍更有可能

190
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:10.330
the alternative hypothesis is true than
that the null hypothesis this is true.
對立假設比虛無假設是真的

191
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.100
It's possible to find this pattern of
results when there is no true effect.
有可能找到這種模式的結果當沒有真正的效果

192
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.430
But it's massively more probable that
you'll find this pattern of results
但是，這很可能是更可能的
你會發現這種模式的結果

193
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.490
when there is a true effect.
當有真正的效果

194
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.900
We can plot this likelihood function,
我們可以繪製這個似然函數

195
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.439
because you might not be convinced that
80% power is very likely in this case.
因為你可能不會相信
在這種情況下，80％的power很有可能

196
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:32.358
Now if you look at this graph, we can
again see the likelihood function which is
現在，如果你看這張圖，我們可以
再次看到似然函數是

197
00:12:32.358 --> 00:12:34.890
plotted for
two out of three significant results.
繪製為三分之二的重要成果

198
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:41.750
I've indicated two points,
the 0.05 theta on the left,
我已經指出了兩點，
左側的0.05 theta，

199
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.974
and the 0.8 theta on the right.
右側為0.8度

200
00:12:44.974 --> 00:12:50.580
Now the 0.05 is the type one error rate,
or your alpha, so that's pretty fixed.
現在0.05是第一種錯誤率，
或者你的alpha，所以這是非常固定的

201
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.900
But maybe you feel like you might
have had lower power in your study.
但也許你覺得你可能會
在你的研究中有較低的power

202
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.960
And you can look at
the relative likelihood of
你可以看相對的似然值

203
00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.620
the outcome of two out of three studies
for any value of theta that you like.
三項研究中的兩項成果
對於任何你喜歡的theta值

204
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.170
The most probable situation, of course, is
that for exactly the result that we have
最可能的情況當然是
這正是我們擁有的結果

205
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:11.539
observed, two out of three
significant results, meaning 0.666.
觀察到，三分之二
重要結果，意義為0.666

206
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.330
For any of these values, you can see that
as long as you assume a decent level of
對於任何這些值，你可以看到
只要你假設一個體面水平

207
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.846
power, something higher than 0.5,
的power, 高於0.5

208
00:13:20.846 --> 00:13:26.026
it's much more likely that there is a true
effect than that there is no true effect,
這更有可能是真的效果比沒有真正的效果，

209
00:13:26.026 --> 00:13:31.211
even though we only observed two out of
three statistically significant results.
即使我們只觀察到了三分之二的統計顯著的結果

210
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:34.991
Now this is an important realization that
you can get by looking at these likelihood
現在這是一個重要的覺悟那你可以看看這些似然值

211
00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:35.590
functions.
函數

212
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:42.160
Multiple studies should give mixed results
when the alternative hypothesis is true.
多項研究應該給出不同的結果
當對立假設是真實的。

213
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.910
And even when you have a decent level
of power, this will happen quite often.
即使你有一個體面的水平
的power，這將經常發生。

214
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.760
What's the likelihood of finding
three significant results in a row
找連續三個重要成果的似然值

215
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.840
when you only have 80% power?
當你只有80％的power？

216
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.710
I'm saying only, but
我只是說，但是

217
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.660
that's actually a pretty decent and
recommended level of power, right?
這實際上是一個相當體面的
推薦水平的power，對吧？

218
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.014
So we can do the math, it's quite easy,
所以我們可以做數學，這很容易，

219
00:14:02.014 --> 00:14:06.546
0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 gives you
a likelihood of 0.51.
0.51的似然值

220
00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:10.500
So about 50% of the time,
when you have 80% power and
所以約50％的時間，當你有80％的power和

221
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.150
the alternative hypothesis is true, you'll
find three significant results in a row.
對立假設是真的，你會連續找到三個重要結果

222
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:19.600
It means that almost 50% of the time, you
will get some version of mixed results.
這意味著近50％的時間，你會得到一些版本的混合結果

223
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.780
Either two out of three,
one out of three, or
三分之二，三分之一，或

224
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.010
if you're unlucky, even zero out of three.
如果你不幸，甚至是三分之零。

225
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.080
Even though there might be a true effect.
即使可能會有真正的效果。

226
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.099
Now this won't happen so often, but
all these outcomes are probable.
現在這不會經常發生，但是所有這些結果都是可能的

227
00:14:29.099 --> 00:14:33.590
And the probability of mixed
result is almost 50% of the time.
和混合的概率結果是近50％的時間。

228
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.810
So this is important to realize,
when you're doing lines of research,
所以這是重要的，當你在做研究行時，

229
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.890
you will not find consistently significant
results in all of your studies, and
你不會總是發現重要結果在你的研究，和

230
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.190
this is perfectly fine.
這是可以接受的

231
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.251
This is exactly what you should expect.
這正是你應該期待的

232
00:14:46.454 --> 00:14:50.642
Now in this graph I've plotted a lot
of lines that are relevant for
現在在這張圖中我畫了很多
的相關線給

233
00:14:50.642 --> 00:14:53.470
a situation where we perform four studies.
我們進行四項研究的情況。

234
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.760
When we perform four studies, we can
either observe zero significant results,
當我們進行四項研究，我們可以
觀察到零重要結果

235
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.830
or one, or two, or three, or four.
或一個，二個，三個，四個。

236
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.980
So each of these curves plots one
of these likelihood functions,
所以這些曲線每一個繪製一個
的這些似然函數

237
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.469
given the data that we've observed.
從我們觀察到的數據

238
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.080
Now what I want to point out here is,
現在我想在這裡指出的是

239
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.800
again, the massive probability
of finding mixed results.
再次，找到混合的結果的巨大概率

240
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.100
And we can see this for
all the curves for one, two, three, or
我們可以看到這一點所有曲線為一，二，三，或

241
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:24.220
four out of four results, where the
likelihood is highest for mixed results.
四分之四的結果，哪裡混合結果的可能性最大

242
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.496
And that's actually this area.
這實際上是這個領域

243
00:15:26.496 --> 00:15:32.441
So when we perform four studies, and the
theta, which means the power that we have,
所以當我們進行四個研究，和
theta，這意味著我們擁有的power

244
00:15:32.441 --> 00:15:38.418
is somewhere between 0.2 and 0.8,
so between 20% power and 80% power.
在0.2到0.8之間，
所以在20％的power和80％的power之間

245
00:15:38.418 --> 00:15:42.912
Then finding mixed results is actually the
most probable outcome of a line of four
然後找到混合的結果實際上是最可能的結果是一行四項

246
00:15:42.912 --> 00:15:43.519
studies.
研究

247
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.430
Now we've seen that likelihood ratios
allow you to express the relative
現在我們已經看到了似然比值
讓你表達相關證據

248
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:52.710
evidence for the null hypothesis
compared to the alternative hypothesis.
對於虛無假設與對立假設相比

249
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.040
And this can be very useful in itself.
這本身就非常有用

250
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.105
For example, we applied this to
the probability of finding significant or
例如，我們將其應用於找到重要或

251
00:15:59.105 --> 00:16:01.540
non-significant results
in a set of studies.
不重要結果的幾率在一組研究中

252
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.060
And we've seen that it's
actually quite likely
我們已經看到了其實很可能

253
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.065
that you'll observe
a mix of significant and
你會觀察到的重要和

254
00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:09.380
non-significant results, even when
the alternative hypothesis is true.
不重要混合的結果即使對立假設是真實的

255
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.790
Likelihoods also underlie
Bayesian statistics.
似然值也是包括貝葉斯統計

256
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.973
So knowing likelihoods is also
a good stepping stone to move on
所以知道似然值也是一個很好的踏板

257
00:16:16.973 --> 00:16:20.233
to Bayesian statistics,
which we'll do in future lectures.
去學習貝葉斯統計, 我們將在未來的講座中做

258
00:16:20.233 --> 00:16:25.109
