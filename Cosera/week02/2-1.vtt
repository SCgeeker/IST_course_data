[似然值]

2
00:00:10.225 --> 00:00:12.830
In this lecture we will
talk about likelihoods.   
這一講介紹的是似然值

3
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.700
Likelihoods are a way to express
the relative evidence for  
似然值呈現兩個假說間的相對證據力

4
00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.770
one hypothesis over another hypothesis.   
似然值呈現兩個假說間的相對證據力

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.210
They can be very useful in themselves.   
似然值的用處很多

6
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.890
But they are also underlying
a lot of Bayesian statistics,   
至於似然值在貝氏統計學的用處

7
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.100
as we'll see in later lectures.   
是下一講的主題

8
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.018
A likelihood gives you the function
of a parameter given the data.      
似然值是資料函數的參數「L(θ)」


9
00:00:30.018 --> 00:00:33.900
So when you've observed some data, you
can pull up the accompanying likelihood   
從觀察資料中得出似然值函數

10
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.660
function and you can check how likely
each hypothesis that you might have is.   
來評估不同假說得到支持的可能性

11
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.480
In this example, we mainly focus on
the binomial likelihood function.   
以最簡單的二項似然函數為例

12
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.920
This is the easiest situation.   
以最簡單的二項似然函數為例

13
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.159
It's like flipping a coin and   
假設你擲硬幣數次

14
00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.500
then counting the number of
heads that you have observed.   
記下正面出現的次數

15
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.460
This is the binomial likelihood function.   
就會得到一條二項似然函數

16
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.220
I won't explain it in detail here, but   
在此我不說明細節   
而是當成作業

17
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.650
there's an accompanying assignment in
which we dive into the function and      
請你以不同觀測值，計算出對應的似然值

18
00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.620
calculate some likelihoods for different
of observations of number of heads.   
請你以不同觀測值，計算出對應的似然值

19
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.100
For now, let's take a look at the
situation where we flip a coin ten times.   
讓我們瞧瞧擲硬幣10次的情形

20
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.720
Eight of these ten times we find
that the coin comes up heads.   
其中有8次硬幣正面朝上

21
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.900
We can calculate the likelihood of theta,   
基於這些數據   
我們已經可以計算似然值θ了

22
00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.000
and theta in this case is a Greek letter
that explains the true hypotheses.   
但是θ是指什麼呢？   
首先是代表真實假說的希臘字母(讀音theta)

23
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.450
And in this case we might assume that the
true underlying number of heads that we   
其次是指只要你擲夠多次硬幣，   
觀察到正面硬幣的次數比值


24
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.820
will observe if we do this
in the long run is 0.8.   
其次是指只要你擲夠多次硬幣，   
觀察到正面硬幣的次數比值

25
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.233
So for the theta of 0.8, we can
calculate that the likelihood is 0.30.   
所以代入函數，θ等於0.8會得到似然值等於0.30

26
00:01:32.233 --> 00:01:36.260
But we can also calculate the likelihoods
for all sorts of different hypotheses.    
除了θ等於0.8的似然值，還可以計算其他假設的似然值

27
00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.400
Let's say that you have the idea that
the true value of the number of coin flips   
如果你認為觀察到的正面硬幣枚數的機率為70%


28
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.490
in the long run is 70% or a theta of 0.7.      
或是θ等於0.7。你該怎麼計算它的似然值？

29
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.760
The likelihood for this being true,
based on the data that we have observed,   
切記似然值基於我們的觀測數據

30
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.880
eight out of ten coin
flips turned up heads.   
要用「擲10次硬幣出現8枚正面朝上」的函數計算

31
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.504
The likelihood of the true
population effect being 0.7 is 0.23.   
代入函數就會知道，θ等於0.7時   
似然值等於0.23


32
00:01:59.504 --> 00:02:02.200
The likelihood of a theta of 0.6 is 0.12.
θ等於0.6時   
似然值等於0.12

33
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.000
So you can see it becomes less and   
它離你的觀察值(θ等於0.8)越遠

34
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.810
less likely the farther away
you go from the observed data.   
它的似然值也變得越小

35
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.380
Now these numbers are not very clear, so   
至此我們有了比較清楚的圖像

36
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.060
let's take a look at
the likelihood function.   
可以來談談似然函數(likelihood function)

37
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.960
In this graph, you can see
the likelihood function plotted.   
這張圖描繪參數與似然值的函數關係

38
00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.920
On the vertical dimension of this graph,
we have plotted the likelihood.   
縱軸，代表似然值   
橫軸，代表歡察次數比率θ

39
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.840
And on the horizontal dimension,
we have plotted theta.   
縱軸，代表似然值   
橫軸，代表歡察次數比率θ

40
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.494
All different versions
ranging from 0 to 1.
比率數值介於0到1之間   

41
00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.880
So the range of 0 to 1 means that we
will either always observe heads or　　　　　　
幾乎沒有「全是正面」或「毫無正面」的觀察結果

42
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.330
we'll never observe heads.　　　　　　
幾乎沒有「全是正面」或「毫無正面」的觀察結果

43
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.100
Now based on the data we have collected,
we already know that　　　　　
依據收集到的資料可知

44
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.350
it's not possible that we'll never observe
heads or we'll never observe tails.
從未觀察到全是正面或全是反面的結果

45
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.360
Because eight out of ten
turned out to be heads.
由於十次之中最可能看到八次正面


46
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.740
So we've observed both values.
觀察結果應該有正有反

47
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.740
So the extremes are not possible, and
you can see that the likelihood here is 0,
所以最不可能觀察到的結果似然值等於0

48
00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.310
it's very low.　　　　　　　　　　　　　
代表不可能發生

49
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.240
The most likely true population parameter
of the number of coin flips based on
因為觀察得知θ等於0.8
我們就設定這個參數值最接近真正的母數

50
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.010
the data that we have is 0.8, because
this is exactly what we have observed.　　　　　　
因為觀察得知θ等於0.8
我們就設定這個參數值最接近真正的母數

51
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.980
So this is the maximum likelihood.　　　
所以θ等於0.8有最大似然值

52
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.270
Based on the data that
we have in our hands,
因為根據手邊的資料

53
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.430
we can see that 0.8 is the most
likely true population parameter.
0.8最有可能是真實母數

54
00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.218
But some of the values just around
it are also still quite plausible.
0.8附近的θ值也能描述硬幣的性質

55
00:03:17.218 --> 00:03:21.570
So a value of 0.6 is still quite
probable in this case as well.　
例如θ等於0.6也是蠻有可能的

56
00:03:24.045 --> 00:03:27.355
These types of likelihood curves
were invented by Ronald Fisher,
上週介紹的費雪是第一個提出似然曲線(likelihood curves)的學者

57
00:03:27.355 --> 00:03:30.365
I already said he was a really,
really smart guy.
我必須說他真的是個天才

58
00:03:30.365 --> 00:03:34.525
And he invented these likelihoods when he
was only 22 years old and actually a 3rd
22歲時還是大三的他就提出似然曲線

59
00:03:34.525 --> 00:03:40.005
year undergraduate student, so this sort
of testifies to his genius, I would say.
我認為這真的該歸於他的天份

60
00:03:40.005 --> 00:03:43.165
Sometimes I wonder what have I been doing
the last couple of years, definitely   
有時我捫心自問  
我在大學畢業前能發明統計學的基石嗎？

61
00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:46.970
not inventing something like this that's
a fundament of modern statistics.      
有時我捫心自問  
我在大學畢業前能發明統計學的基石嗎？

62
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:52.080
Now we can use the likelihood
under the null hypothesis and   
現在，我們可以用虛無假設的似然值

63
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.200
the likelihood under
the alternative hypothesis   
以及對立假設的似然值

64
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.530
to calculate something that's
known as the likelihood ratio.   
來計算似然比(likelihood ratio)

65
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.810
So in the case of likelihood ratio,
we're taking the relative evidence for
似然比是虛無假設成立對比
對立假設成立的賠率(odds)

66
00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.510
the one hypothesis, the null,
and the other hypothesis,
似然比是虛無假設成立對比
對立假設成立的賠率(odds)

67
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.620
the alternative, and we can calculate
the odds of one over the other.
顯示手上證據支持兩者的相對程度

68
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.990
Let's look at our example,
where we had eight out of ten coin flips.
拿一開始的例子來說,投了硬幣十次有八次正面

69
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.850
Now we need to compare two hypotheses, and
我們可以拿函數裡的任兩個θ
代表要比較的兩個假設

70
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.620
you're free to choose any two
values of theta that you want.
我們可以拿函數裡的任兩個θ
代表要比較的兩個假設

71
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.593
But one very logical value would be 50%,
0.5,
不過比較合理的一個數值是50%
	
72
00:04:25.593 --> 00:04:30.373
the hypothesis that this is
a perfectly balanced and fair coin.
表示我們假設這個硬幣是絕對公平的

73
00:04:30.373 --> 00:04:35.890
So this is the value that's plotted
at 0.5 on the horizontal axis.
所以代表這這個假設的數值是0.5

74
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.610
And you can compare this with any
hypothesis you had in advance.
你可以用這個值與你有興趣的所有假設比較

75
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.280
The alternative hypothesis I've
chosen here is the value 0.8.
我選擇的對立假設數值是0.8

76
00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.730
This happens to be exactly the value
that we've observed in the data.
這個數值正是我們實際觀察到的

77
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:49.010
Eight out of ten coin flips.
十次之中有八次正面朝上

78
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.863
Now we're comparing this alternative
hypothesis that a true population
現在我們要比較的這個對立假設
設定真正的母數是0.8

79
00:04:52.863 --> 00:04:54.050
parameter is 0.8.
現在我們要比較的這個對立假設
設定真正的母數是0.8

80
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.097
So 80% of the time this coin
will come up heads, and
表示投擲十次會有八次是正面

81
00:04:57.097 --> 00:05:00.756
we'll compare it to the null hypothesis,
the value of 0.5,
而虛無假設的數值0.5

82
00:05:00.756 --> 00:05:03.970
the idea that this is
a perfectly balanced, fair coin.
代表這個硬幣絕對公平的主張

83
00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.190
Now we can already see in the graph
that the likelihood is much
從圖中可看到0.8的似然值
比0.5的似然值還高

84
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.170
higher at 0.8 than it is at 0.5.
從圖中可看到0.8的似然值
比0.5的似然值還高

85
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.030
But what we want to know is,
how much more likely?
但是我們想知道的是,有多少可能性?

86
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.300
And the likelihood ratio
gives us an idea of this.
似然比能給我們這個答案

87
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.769
It's basically dividing the likelihood
at 0.8 by the likelihood at 0.5.
基本上只要把0.8的似然值除以0.5的似然值

88
00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:23.270
And in this case, this ratio is 6.87.
得到的似然比是6.87

89
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.173
So it's quite more likely that
the true population parameter is
所以母數是0.8的可能性是0.5的六倍多

90
00:05:28.173 --> 00:05:33.269
0.8 compared to the ID that
the population parameters 0.5.
所以母數是0.8的可能性是0.5的六倍多
 
91
00:05:35.021 --> 00:05:38.390
Now we can test any values that we want.
現在我們可以檢驗任何我們想比較的數值

92
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.910
Let say that in advance we still had
the same alternative hypothesis,
這個例子也是測試相同的對立假設

93
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.980
that this was a coin that would
come up heads 80% of the time.
就是這枚硬幣投擲十次會有八次正面

94
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.850
We still compare it to the probability
that this is a fair coin.
另一方面我們也認為這是一枚公正的硬幣

95
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:54.000
So these two hypotheses are being
compared, but now we have observed data
為了比較這兩個假設，我們重新收集資料

96
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.700
where the coin comes up heads
four times out of ten flips.
卻發現投這枚硬幣十次有四次正面

97
00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.263
So we can see the shape of the likelihood
function is very different, and
所以似然函數的曲線改變了

98
00:06:02.263 --> 00:06:04.803
in this case of course,
based on the observed data,
而且根據觀察的數據
似然值0.4的可能性最高

99
00:06:04.803 --> 00:06:06.857
the likelihood of 0.4 is most likely.
而且根據觀察的數據
似然值0.4的可能性最高

100
00:06:06.857 --> 00:06:12.002
We can still compare the ratio of
the likelihoods at 0.5 and 0.8,
以此計算0.5和0.8的似然比

101
00:06:12.002 --> 00:06:17.960
and now we see that the value of 0.5 is
much more likely than the value at 0.8.
發現母數是0.5的可能性比0.8還高

102
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.930
So the hypothesis that this is a fair
coin is now much more likely than
所以這是一枚公正硬幣的假設

103
00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:25.220
the hypothesis that this
is an unfair coin, and
比這是一枚不公正硬幣的假設更合理

104
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.039
that the true population parameter is 0.8.
真正的母數應該是0.5
(Daniel可能說錯)

105
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.800
Now when you calculate likelihood ratios,
there are two cutoffs of 8 and
似然比有兩個截止值為8和32

106
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.540
32 of these likelihood ratios which
are considered either moderately strong
之間的數值被認為顯示中等強度證據

107
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.150
evidence or strong evidence.
或強度證據

108
00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.450
So in the previous examples, we could see
that in the first case, we had not yet
在擲硬幣例子裡，
第一種結果的證據強度(6.87)並未達到中等水準

109
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.190
moderately strong evidence for
the difference in the hypotheses.
在擲硬幣例子裡，
第一種結果的證據強度(6.87)並未達到中等水準

110
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.760
In the latter case, when we observed four
out of ten flips coming up heads, we can
第二種觀察到投擲硬幣十次有四次正面

111
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.840
see that this was very strong evidence for
the fair coin hypothesis compared to
表示這是枚公正硬幣的證據強度(37.25)超過水準

112
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:05.250
the alternative, that this was a coin
with 0.8 coin flips coming up heads.
遠高於這枚硬幣有0.8機率擲出正面的對立假設

113
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.000
So you see that likelihoods
are relative evidence for
所以似然值是對立假設與虛無假設
的相對證據強度

114
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.790
the alternative hypothesis
compared to the null hypothesis.
所以似然值是對立假設與虛無假設
的相對證據強度

115
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.660
It's important to realize that both of
these hypotheses might be quite unlikely.
但是你要了解兩者可能都是很難得到證據支持的假設

116
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.649
Let's look at an example.
我們來看這一個例子

117
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.220
Now here we flip the coin 100 times, and
現在投擲一枚硬幣100次

118
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:30.210
50 out of the 100 times,
the coin came up heads.
其中有50次正面朝上

119
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.460
Now, we are comparing two hypotheses here,
the one being that the true population
我們要比較的兩個假設，
其中一個設定母數θ是0.3

120
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:41.520
parameter is 30% heads in the long run,
so a theta of 0.3.
也就是持續投擲硬幣有30%正面朝上

121
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.890
The alternative hypothesis is that
the true population parameter is at
對立假設主張母數是0.8

122
00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:49.620
theta of 0.8, so
we'll see 80% heads in the long run.
也就是持續投擲硬幣有80%正面朝上

123
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:54.593
When we compare these two
hypotheses against each other,
用這道函數比較這兩個假設

124
00:07:54.593 --> 00:08:00.222
we can see that the hypothesis that true
population parameter is 0.3 is massively
可以看出假設母數是0.3比母數是0.8更有可能

125
00:08:00.222 --> 00:08:05.547
more likely than the likelihood that
the true population parameter is 0.8.
可以看出假設母數是0.3比母數是0.8更有可能

126
00:08:05.547 --> 00:08:09.330
And we find a ridiculously
high likelihood ratio.
這是因為得到一個很高的似然比

127
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:11.974
However, we can also see that
both these hypotheses are wrong.
但是也可以看到這兩個假設都是錯誤的

128
00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:17.487
So even though the relative evidence for
the one hypothesis compare to the other
所以即使是一個假設比另一個假設的相對證據

129
00:08:17.487 --> 00:08:22.471
hypothesis is extremely convincing, we
didn't find the true population parameter,
更有說服力, 觀察結果都沒有呈現真正的母數

130
00:08:22.471 --> 00:08:24.981
which is actually just 0.5 in this case.
也就是投出正面的比率是0.5

131
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:28.485
So it's important to keep in mind that
likelihood ratios are relative evidence.
所以務必記住似然比是相對的證據強度

132
00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:36.340
Now we can compare the likelihood under
the null hypothesis of a theta of 0.05 and
這個例子比較的虛無假設參數是0.05
對立假設參數是0.8

133
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:42.237
an alternative hypothesis of 0.8.
這個例子比較的虛無假設參數是0.05
對立假設參數是0.8

134
00:08:42.237 --> 00:08:45.070
Now one way in which you can think about
你可以考慮應用這樣的似然比在你自己的資料分析

135
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:50.030
applying these likelihood ratios is when
you think about the outcomes of studies.
你可以考慮應用這樣的似然比在你自己的資料分析

136
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.030
Now, if you perform a study,
it's sort of like a coin flip.
如果你的研究很像觀察投擲硬幣的結果

137
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:56.600
You can either find a statistically
significant result, or not.
結果有可能是統計顯著，或者不顯著

138
00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.600
So this is one of two options,
and it's a binomial probability.
兩種結果發生的機率都能用二項機率表示

139
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.210
So how often will you find
a significant result, and
表示有多少次實驗能觀察到顯著結果？

140
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.530
how often will you find
a non-significant result?
以及有多少次實驗能觀察到不顯著結果？

141
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.330
Well it depends on whether
the null hypothesis is true or
這與虛無假設主張為真或

142
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:10.970
the alternative hypothesis is true.
對立假設主張為真有關

143
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:14.182
When the null hypothesis is true,
we know that you'll find
虛無假設主張為真時，
似然值告訴你發現顯著結果的機率

144
00:09:14.182 --> 00:09:18.825
a significant result that equals your
alpha level, which is typically 0.05%.
相當於一般設定的顯著水準，也就是0.05%

145 
00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:22.700
So this is a very good null hypothesis
in these likelihood ratios.
以似然比來看，這樣的虛無假設設定非常不錯

146
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:27.780
We can compare this with the probability
of finding significant results when
與真正有效果且發現顯著結果的機率比較
能顯出邏輯與證據的意義

147
00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:28.760
there is a true effect.
與真正有效果且發現顯著結果的機率比較
能顯出邏輯與證據的意義

148
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.640
And in this case, this probability
depends on the statistical
所以用的統計檢定法的考驗力(power)也很重要


149
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.900
power that you have in your test.
所以用的統計檢定法的考驗力(power)也很重要

150
00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.183
Let's for now put it at 0.8, so
也就是這張投影片提到的0.8

151
00:09:35.183 --> 00:09:40.330
80% of the time you'll find a significant
result because you had 80% power.
代表檢定有80%的考驗力，能發現顯著結果的機率

152
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.400
Now we can use the likelihood function
to compare the probability that we have
現在透過似然函數比較
虛無假設主張為真並有顯著結果的機率

153
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.870
observed a significant result
under the null hypothesis, and
現在透過似然函數比較
虛無假設主張為真並有顯著結果的機率

154
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.580
compare it with
the alternative hypothesis.
與對立假設主張為真並有顯著結果的機率

155
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.998
Let's say that we perform
three studies in a row.
假想一項研究連續做了三次

156
00:09:56.998 --> 00:09:59.980
Now there are a number of outcomes
that could happen, of course.
投影片上的結果都有可能會發生

157
00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:02.530
None of these studies
could come up significant.
有可能沒有一次研究出現顯著結果

158
00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:05.630
You could find only one
significant effect, or two.
也有可能出現一次或兩次顯著結果

159
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.300
Or, if you're really lucky, three
significant results out of three studies.
也許你家裡祖上有德，三次都是顯著結果

160
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:14.760
Now let's calculate
the likelihood of finding two
現在拿三次有二次顯著結果的似然值來做些計算

161
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.350
out of three significant results.
現在拿三次有二次顯著結果的似然值來做些計算

162
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.900
When the null hypothesis is true,
this is pretty straightforward.
如果虛無假設主張為真，似然值的計算很簡單

163
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:25.440
The probability of finding a significant
effect when there's no true effect
代表沒有真正效果卻發現顯著結果的機率

164
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.200
is the alpha level, so
this is 0.05% of the time.
相當於顯著水準
也就是只有0.05%的實驗結果是顯著的

165
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.530
We multiply it by two significant studies.
似然值就是兩次顯著結果的相乘

166
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:35.652
So 5% times 5%.
就是5%乘以5%

167
00:10:35.652 --> 00:10:40.270
And then we multiply it by the probability
of finding no significant effect.
再乘以其餘一次沒有顯著結果的機率

168
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.500
Well, if we have a 5% alpha level,
then the probability of finding
即然沒有效果卻發現顯著結果的機率是5%
相對沒有發現顯著結果的機率就是95%

169
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.010
no significant effect, if there's
no true effect, is actually 95%.
即然沒有效果卻發現顯著結果的機率是5%
相對沒有發現顯著結果的機率就是95%

170
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:50.934
So if you multiply these probabilities,
把這些機率相乘

171
00:10:50.934 --> 00:10:57.108
5% times 5% times 95%,
we get the value of 0.0024.
也就是5%乘以5%乘以95%
得到的值為0.0024。

172
00:10:57.108 --> 00:11:01.339
All right, so what happens if there
is a true effect to be observed, and
那麼如果真的有效果，
三次研究有兩次顯著結果的似然值該怎麼算？

173
00:11:01.339 --> 00:11:04.174
we find two out of three
significant findings?
那麼如果真的有效果，
三次研究有兩次顯著結果的似然值該怎麼算？

174
00:11:04.174 --> 00:11:07.150
Now let's assume that we have 80% power.
一開始已經設定考驗力是80％

175
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.430
You never really know, but
實際上很難得知真正的考驗力
(第三週課程說明)

176
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:13.450
you can check different levels of power in
the likelihood function when it's plotted.
但是似然函數能描繪各種程度的考驗力對應的似然值

177
00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:15.200
But for now, let's take a look at 80%.
現在來看看考驗力80%的計算結果

178
00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:19.860
So we find two significant results and
one nonsignificant result.
因為有兩次顯著結果與一次不顯著結果

179
00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:24.506
If the alternative hypothesis is true,
this equals an 80% probability of finding
如果對立假設主張為真，
相當於有80％的機率能出現顯著結果

180
00:11:24.506 --> 00:11:27.474
a significant result,
times an 80% probability of
如果對立假設主張為真，
相當於有80％的機率能出現顯著結果

181
00:11:27.474 --> 00:11:32.200
finding a significant result, times a 20%
probability of making a type two error.
兩個80%相乘，再乘以20%的型二錯誤率

182
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:38.558
And if we now multiply these
probabilities, we get 0.128.
就會得到似然值是0.128

183
00:11:38.558 --> 00:11:42.745
So we can calculate the relative
likelihood of observing this data,
所以接著能計算三次研究結果有兩次是統計顯著

184
00:11:42.745 --> 00:11:47.654
two out of three significant results,
when either the null hypothesis is true,
虛無假設主張與真對比對立假設主張為真的似然比

185
00:11:47.654 --> 00:11:50.130
or the alternative hypothesis is true.
虛無假設主張與真對比對立假設主張為真的似然比

186
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.540
Now based on these numbers, you can
already see that this outcome is much
根據計算結果(0.128/0.0024)
可以得知有真正效果的可能性

187
00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.660
more likely when there is a true effect
than when there is no true effect.
高於沒有真正的效果的可能性

188
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.600
So, if we calculate likelihood ratio,
似然比是54

189
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.070
we see that it's actually
54 times more likely that
表示對立假設為真的可能性
是虛無假設為真的54倍

190
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:10.330
the alternative hypothesis is true than
that the null hypothesis this is true.
表示對立假設為真的可能性
是虛無假設為真的54倍

191
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:14.100
It's possible to find this pattern of
results when there is no true effect.
雖然現在的分析結果是沒有真正效果的發現

192
00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.430
But it's massively more probable that
you'll find this pattern of results
但是更有可能是有真正效果的發現

193
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.490
when there is a true effect.
但是更有可能是有真正效果的發現

194
00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.900
We can plot this likelihood function,
把這個例子繪製成似然函數

195
00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:27.439
because you might not be convinced that
80% power is very likely in this case.
更能說服你，
有80%檢定力的分析的可信度有多高

196
00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:32.358
Now if you look at this graph, we can
again see the likelihood function which is
圖中標示三次研究有兩次顯著結果的似然比是怎麼回事

197
00:12:32.358 --> 00:12:34.890
plotted for
two out of three significant results.
圖中標示三次研究有兩次顯著結果的似然比是怎麼回事

198
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:41.750
I've indicated two points,
the 0.05 theta on the left,
請注意橫軸左側的0.05和右側的0.8

199
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.974
and the 0.8 theta on the right.
請注意橫軸左側的0.05和右側的0.8

200
00:12:44.974 --> 00:12:50.580
Now the 0.05 is the type one error rate,
or your alpha, so that's pretty fixed.
0.05表示型一錯誤率，或者顯著水準
是許多研究的通用設定

201
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:53.900
But maybe you feel like you might
have had lower power in your study.
不過你也許認為自己的研究沒那麼高的檢定力

202
00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.960
And you can look at
the relative likelihood of
要檢查不同程度的檢定力

203
00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:01.620
the outcome of two out of three studies
for any value of theta that you like.
發現三次研究有兩次顯著的似然比

204
00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:07.170
The most probable situation, of course, is
that for exactly the result that we have
最可能的檢定力就是實際的狀況

205
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:11.539
observed, two out of three
significant results, meaning 0.666.
也就是三次之中有兩次顯著結果，正是0.666

206
00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:18.330
For any of these values, you can see that
as long as you assume a decent level of
不論抓那個數值，只要考檢定力高於一定程度，
像是0.5

207
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.846
power, something higher than 0.5,
不論抓那個數值，只要考檢定力高於一定程度，
像是0.5

208
00:13:20.846 --> 00:13:26.026
it's much more likely that there is a true
effect than that there is no true effect,
有真的效果的可能性
比沒有真正的效果的可能性高

209
00:13:26.026 --> 00:13:31.211
even though we only observed two out of
three statistically significant results.
即使三次研究只有二次統計顯著結果

210
00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:34.991
Now this is an important realization that
you can get by looking at these likelihood
由此我們學到重要的一課
似然函數能如何幫我們評估多次研究的結果

211
00:13:34.991 --> 00:13:35.590
functions.
由此我們學到重要的一課
似然函數能如何幫我們評估多次研究的結果

212
00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:42.160
Multiple studies should give mixed results
when the alternative hypothesis is true.
當對立假設主張為真
多次研究應該呈現顯著與不顯著的結果

213
00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.910
And even when you have a decent level
of power, this will happen quite often.
即使檢定力沒有達到前例的水準
也應該有相似的發現

214
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.760
What's the likelihood of finding
three significant results in a row
如果檢定力有80%
三次研究都是顯著結果的似然值有多少？

215
00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.840
when you only have 80% power?
如果檢定力有80%
三次研究都是顯著結果的似然值有多少？

216
00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:53.710
I'm saying only, but
我再提醒一下

217
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:57.660
that's actually a pretty decent and
recommended level of power, right?
80%是有起碼品質的研究建議應維持的檢定力水準
(見1-3講)

218
00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:02.014
So we can do the math, it's quite easy,
我們做點算術就能明白這項建議的道理

219
00:14:02.014 --> 00:14:06.546
0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8 gives you
a likelihood of 0.51.
0.8相乘3次，得到0.51的似然值

220
00:14:06.546 --> 00:14:10.500
So about 50% of the time,
when you have 80% power and
這表示只要對立假設主張為真，檢定力維持在80%

221
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:15.150
the alternative hypothesis is true, you'll
find three significant results in a row.
同樣的研究重覆數次，有50%的機率你會發現三次顯著結果

222
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:19.600
It means that almost 50% of the time, you
will get some version of mixed results.
另外50%的結果會是只有二次、一次、甚至沒有統計顯著

223
00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.780
Either two out of three,
one out of three, or
另外50%的結果會是只有二次、一次、甚至沒有統計顯著

224
00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:24.010
if you're unlucky, even zero out of three.
另外50%的結果會是只有二次、一次、甚至沒有統計顯著

225
00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:26.080
Even though there might be a true effect.
即使分析背後確實有真正的效果

226
00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:29.099
Now this won't happen so often, but
all these outcomes are probable.
雖然不顯著不會經常發生，
但是任何分析結果都是有可能的

227
00:14:29.099 --> 00:14:33.590
And the probability of mixed
result is almost 50% of the time.
多次研究存在至少一次不顯著結果的機率是50％

228
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:36.810
So this is important to realize,
when you're doing lines of research,
當你分析的研究資料是多次實驗資料
請謹記在心

229
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:40.890
you will not find consistently significant
results in all of your studies, and
所有研究結果至少有一次不顯著是很正常的

230
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:42.190
this is perfectly fine.
所有研究結果至少有一次不顯著是很正常的

231
00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:44.251
This is exactly what you should expect.
不該期待所有結果都是統計顯著

232
00:14:46.454 --> 00:14:50.642
Now in this graph I've plotted a lot
of lines that are relevant for
這張圖描繪有四項研究的資料
分析結果顯著與否的排列組合及似然值

233
00:14:50.642 --> 00:14:53.470
a situation where we perform four studies.
這張圖描繪有四項研究的資料
分析結果顯著與否的排列組合及似然值

234
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:58.760
When we perform four studies, we can
either observe zero significant results,
分析結果會是都沒有顯著結果

235
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.830
or one, or two, or three, or four.
或者有一次，二次，三次，或四次顯著結果。

236
00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:05.980
So each of these curves plots one
of these likelihood functions,
每一條曲線代表一種分析結果的似然函數

237
00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.469
given the data that we've observed.
每一條曲線代表一種分析結果的似然函數

238
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.080
Now what I want to point out here is,
這些曲線顯示發現至少一個不顯著結果的機率有多高

239
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.800
again, the massive probability
of finding mixed results.
這些曲線顯示發現至少一個不顯著結果的機率有多高

240
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:19.100
And we can see this for
all the curves for one, two, three, or
把每條曲線對應至少一個不顯著結果的似然值標出來

241
00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:24.220
four out of four results, where the
likelihood is highest for mixed results.
把每條曲線對應至少一個不顯著結果的似然值標出來

242
00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.496
And that's actually this area.
可以標出這塊區域

243
00:15:26.496 --> 00:15:32.441
So when we perform four studies, and the
theta, which means the power that we have,
這塊區域表示四次研究要找的母數
運用的分析方法檢定力

244
00:15:32.441 --> 00:15:38.418
is somewhere between 0.2 and 0.8,
so between 20% power and 80% power.
在20%到80%之間的似然值

245
00:15:38.418 --> 00:15:42.912
Then finding mixed results is actually the
most probable outcome of a line of four
不論四次之中顯著結果有多少，
各種結果出現的機會是差不多的

246
00:15:42.912 --> 00:15:43.519
studies.
不論四次之中顯著結果有多少，
各種結果出現的機會是差不多的

247
00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:48.430
Now we've seen that likelihood ratios
allow you to express the relative
這一講學到似然比如何表示
虛無假設與對立假設的相對證據強度

248
00:15:48.430 --> 00:15:52.710
evidence for the null hypothesis
compared to the alternative hypothesis.
這一講學到似然比如何表示
虛無假設與對立假設的相對證據強度

249
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:55.040
And this can be very useful in itself.
是相當有用的分析工具

250
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:59.105
For example, we applied this to
the probability of finding significant or
像是評估一組研究發現顯著或不顯著結果的機率

251
00:15:59.105 --> 00:16:01.540
non-significant results
in a set of studies.
像是評估一組研究發現顯著或不顯著結果的機率

252
00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:04.060
And we've seen that it's
actually quite likely
由最後一個例子學到

253
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.065
that you'll observe
a mix of significant and
即使對立假設主張為真

254
00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:09.380
non-significant results, even when
the alternative hypothesis is true.
分析結果有顯著與不顯著是很正常的

255
00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.790
Likelihoods also underlie
Bayesian statistics.
似然值也是貝氏統計的基礎

256
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:16.973
So knowing likelihoods is also
a good stepping stone to move on
了解似然值也是學習貝氏統計的入門磚

257
00:16:16.973 --> 00:16:20.233
to Bayesian statistics,
which we'll do in future lectures.
