00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.421  
[訪問佐爾丹．丹尼斯]  
  
2  
00:00:08.421 --> 00:00:12.895  
So here we are with Zoltan Dienes,  
the author of this book,  
今天我們訪問佐爾丹．丹尼斯(Zoltan Dienes)
他是「Understanding Psychology as a Science」的作者  
  
3  
00:00:12.895 --> 00:00:16.610  
Understanding Psychology as a Science.  
今天我們訪問佐爾丹．丹尼斯(Zoltan Dienes)
他是「Understanding Psychology as a Science」的作者  
  
4  
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.000  
Zoltan, it's really nice  
that you want to be here.  
佐爾丹你好，謝謝你接受訪問
  
5  
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.710  
Nice to be here.  
這是我的榮幸  
  
6  
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.990  
Take some time from this  
conference that we're at.  
我們在這場研討會的空檔做個訪談  
  
7  
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.510  
Taking some time for this interview.  
我們在這場研討會的空檔做個訪談  
  
8  
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.170  
So first of all I was wondering,  
how did you get into this topic?  
首先我想問的是  
你是如何開始接觸這本書的主題?  
  
9  
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.450  
What decided that you would write about  
things like this or find them interesting?  
是有什麼發現讓你感到特別有興趣的嗎?  
  
10  
00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.090  
My interest goes back quite a way,  
actually.  
其實我從很小就對這方面主題有興趣了  
  
11  
00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.110  
My mother was a Scientologist.  
我母親是位科學教(山達基)的信徒  
  
12  
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.770  
And the headmaster of the sixth form  
I was in gave me a book on Popper.  
我高中時的校長送了我一本卡爾．波普(Karl Popper)的書  
  
13  
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.110  
So I read about Karl Popper and  
波普的書討論許多關於科學真偽的議題  
  
14  
00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.280  
he discusses what makes something  
a science or not a science.  
波普的書討論許多關於科學真偽的議題  
  
15  
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.172  
And that had a pretty big impact on me and  
how I  
他的書深深影響了當時的我  
  
16  
00:00:53.172 --> 00:00:58.600  
viewed various movements and what they  
might call themselves a science or not.  
如何看待周遭事物是否為真科學  
  
17  
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.310  
The fact that also it's not just a label,  
but Popper wanted to point out that  
波普想指出的重點不在於分別科學的「真」或「假」  
  
18  
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:10.390  
how you approach that really matters to  
the quality of the knowledge that you get.  
而是你如何正確地理解你吸收的知識  
  
19  
00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.960  
I see that you have some interests  
in one of the examples comes from  
我注意到你書中有些例子來自  
  
20  
00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.760  
precognition research and psi research.  
超感知覺及超能力的研究  
  
21  
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.120  
And you did some studies  
about it yourself, right?  
你對這方面有所涉獵，是吧?  
  
22  
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.800  
Yes, now there's a topic  
where the philosophy of science,  
是的，這是現在的科學哲學  
  
23  
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.920  
the philosophy of  
statistics really comes up.  
也是統計哲學正在熱烈探討的一個問題  
  
24  
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.900  
So if you investigate  
a topic where a lot of people  
如果今天你想研究的假設  
  
25  
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.640  
think the hypothesis theory has  
a very low or high probability.  
被絕大多數人認為是真的機率很高或很低  
  
26  
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.660  
Then just using p-values and p less  
than 0.05, somehow doesn't seem right.  
那麼只看p值及設定顯著水準(0.05)似乎是不夠的  
  
27  
00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.995  
And then to make a binding decision at  
the end of that doesn't seem right.  
以此推論出來的結果也不像是對的  
  
28  
00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:48.910  
Whereas saying there's a certain  
amount of evidence here and  
實際情況比較像是今天若有一定量的事實證據  
  
29  
00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.830  
that will change your  
opinion by a certain amount.  
這些證據累積一定程度能夠改變你對某件事的想法  
  
30  
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.437  
Just seeing the better way  
of dealing with theories  
我只是覺得該有更好的方式來看待這些理論  
  
31  
00:01:56.437 --> 00:02:00.380  
where people might have radically  
views about them in the first place.  
尤其是在那些人們通常有著先驗信念的情況下  
  
32  
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.616  
So that was in fact my first  
application of Bayesian statistics.  
這也是為何我的書會從貝氏統計開始討論起  
  
33  
00:02:05.616 --> 00:02:07.730  
All right, so  
mainly you were doing that research,  
所以這就是為何你的研究  
  
34  
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.675  
that's when you ventured into this  
direction of Bayesian statistics.  
會從貝氏統計開始"挑戰"  
  
35  
00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:15.245  
Yeah, initially,  
1980s I was doing my PhD at Oxford and  
是的，我和貝氏統計相遇  
是1980年代我還在牛津大學讀博士時  
  
36  
00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:19.545  
Oxford invited this statistician from UCL,  
John Kier,  
學校請了一位倫敦大學(UCL)的統計學家John Kier來授課  
  
37  
00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:25.120  
who had been Piaget's statistician and  
Hans Eysenck's statistician.  
他曾與心理學大師皮亞傑(Piaget)及  
漢斯·艾森克(Hans Eysenck)合作  
  
38  
00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.481  
And he came to teach  
the PhD students at Oxford,  
牛津大學請他每周三下午來教博士生統計  
  
39  
00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:31.604  
every Wednesday afternoon, statistics.  
牛津大學請他每周三下午來教博士生統計  
  
40  
00:02:31.604 --> 00:02:35.510  
I found him quite captivating,  
charismatic.  
他是個相當有魅力的統計學家  
  
41  
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.600  
But he would teach just  
whatever he wanted to teach.  
不過他只教他想教的東西  
  
42  
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.980  
And one term he said I'm  
going to teach you Bayes.  
其中有個學期他說我們來上貝式統計吧  
  
43  
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.884  
And by the end of the term, there's just  
me and one other person sitting there.  
到了學期末教室內只剩下我跟另一個學生  
  
44  
00:02:43.884 --> 00:02:45.656  
[LAUGH]  
And I found it absolutely fascinating,  
那時我發現了貝式統計的迷人之處  
  
45  
00:02:45.656 --> 00:02:48.716  
but the other people just thought this is  
not relevant to my thesis, I'll disappear.  
但大多數同學只覺得與他們的論文無關  
就翹課了  
  
46  
00:02:48.716 --> 00:02:49.219  
All right.  
好的  
  
47  
00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.209  
So  
my little Bayesian base factor calculator  
所以我開發的貝式統計計算程式  
(見Zoltan Dienes個人網站)  
  
48  
00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.040  
actually programmed at that point.  
從那個時候就開始開發了  
(見Zoltan Dienes個人網站)  

49  
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.550  
Okay.  
的確  
  
50  
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.460  
Way back then.  
那個年代  
  
51  
00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.870  
Like 1980s.  
1980年代  
  
52  
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.530  
So that's actually  
an interesting point, right?  
這真是件有趣的事  
  
53  
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.790  
So you say that most of  
these students slowly left.  
所以你說當時那堂課的同學後面都逐漸離開教室  
  
54  
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.550  
But now, of course,  
if you write this book, there's a lot of  
但現在你寫的這本書  
  
55  
00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.895  
topics in here that has to do with  
Bayesian statistics and likelihood.  
裏頭有許多關於貝式統計及似然性的討論  
  
56  
00:03:13.895 --> 00:03:16.555  
So apparently you thought  
it was worthwhile that  
這麼說你認為當初堅持到最後  
  
57  
00:03:16.555 --> 00:03:17.605  
the students shouldn't leave.  
是有價值的囉?  
  
58  
00:03:17.605 --> 00:03:21.605  
Actually you thought it was worthwhile  
to explain more to students about this.  
事實上你應該認為這些知識是值得學生們更深入的了解吧  
  
59  
00:03:21.605 --> 00:03:25.765  
So why do you think it's important that  
students learn about these things?  
那麼你認為為什麼學生該要學習這些知識呢?  
  
60  
00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:31.915  
It's important because there's a debate  
about how one should do statistics  
我想這些知識很重要  
是因為一直以來有相當多關於統計推論的辯論  
  
61  
00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:36.550  
that isn't settled, or  
it seemed to be settled but it wasn't.  
表面上大家好像有共識了  
實則不然  
  
62  
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.320  
And the way we had settled on  
doing things caused problems,  
而大家曾以為是對的的「共識」已經造成許多問題  
  
63  
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.593  
that is why we had the credibility crisis,  
that was a big part of it.  
這也是為何最近學界開始對過去心理學研究結果產生質疑  
  
64  
00:03:44.593 --> 00:03:48.660  
And now people are really thinking  
about how should we do statistics,  
也因此現在大家開始認真思考，  
究竟該怎麼使用統計學  
  
65  
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.930  
how should we do science and  
I think in ten years' time  
去做科學研究  
我想在十年後  
  
66  
00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.300  
results sections are going to look  
rather different than they do now.  
我們使用統計的方式將會跟現在大不相同  
  
67  
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.160  
And you can either be ahead  
of the curve on that or  
你可以選擇現在就開始改變  
  
68  
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.770  
you can be desperately  
trying to catch up later.  
或是日後才努力追趕前人改變的腳步  
  
69  
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.193  
And the people we need to reach  
are the current students coming up.  
而這個時代正在學習的學生們  
  
70  
00:04:07.193 --> 00:04:12.070  
They need to understand these issues,  
and where researchers have gone wrong in  
他們必須了解問題所在  
以及前人所犯過的錯誤  
  
71  
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.790  
the past that led to science that  
wasn't really that credible in the end.  
那些造成當代科學不能被全然信任的錯誤  
  
72  
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.540  
And if you don't understand statistics,  
and the philosophy of  
如果你不徹底了解統計學  
及科學哲學的話  
  
73  
00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.500  
science more generally,  
then you'll make the same mistakes again.  
你將會犯下同樣的錯誤  
  
74  
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.800  
So, I think this is the time to change.  
所以我認為是時候做出改變了  
  
75  
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:30.619  
Change is happening.  
事實上改變已在發生  
  
76  
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.740  
Ten years' time sounds not very different.  
或許十年能做的的改變有限  
  
77  
00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.639  
I actually think in a hundred years time,  
people will look back on how  
但我認為一百年後  
當人們回首過去百年的進展  
  
78  
00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.890  
we do science now and it will be a bit  
like how we look back hundred years ago.  
正如同我們現在回顧一百年前的科學  
  
79  
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:42.772  
It's like really, they did it like that?  
我們會想「以前真的這麼做嗎?」  
「這樣做也太粗糙了」  
  
80  
00:04:42.772 --> 00:04:43.728  
That's pretty primitive.  
我們會想「以前真的這麼做嗎?」  
「這樣做也太粗糙了」  
  
81  
00:04:43.728 --> 00:04:45.440  
Yeah.  
的確  
  
82  
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.710  
And a lot of the changes  
that will be coming about and  
另外也會一直有新的改變出現  
  
83  
00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.560  
affecting how we do science in the future,  
they're happening right now.  
影響我們做科學的方式  
  
84  
00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.470  
All right.  
So that's quite exciting, in a way.  
聽起來真讓人興奮  
  
85  
00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.640  
Yeah, yeah I agree.  
沒錯，我也這麼覺得  
  
86  
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.160  
Okay, very good.  
好的  
  
87  
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.930  
So when you were you exhibiting  
all these things for  
所以你培養這些統計分析與推論的技術  
  
88  
00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.260  
yourself, these statistical techniques and  
所以你培養這些統計分析與推論的技術  
  
89  
00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.820  
figuring out, mainly this was because you  
needed to analyze your own data, right?  
是為了分析你的研究數據資料，是嗎?  
  
90  
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.178  
I mean, you're not In principle  
statistician yourself.  
我意思是說  
儘管你本身並非統計學家出身  
  
91  
00:05:08.178 --> 00:05:11.790  
No trained as a psychologist, exactly.  
的確，我並不是心理學家出身  
  
92  
00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.116  
So you're trying to figure out how to  
use this, so what things were most helpful  
那麼在你學習使用這些技術的過程中  
  
93  
00:05:17.116 --> 00:05:22.693  
to you or most insightful or eye opening  
when you were learning about these things?  
有哪些方法是你覺得特別有用  
或是特別令你大開眼界的經驗?  
  
94  
00:05:22.693 --> 00:05:27.433  
I think when I wrote the book and  
I don't know if it comes across there but  
我想當初我在寫書的時候  
  
95  
00:05:27.433 --> 00:05:31.002  
probably as leaning towards  
a likelihood approach.  
儘管並非特意  
卻不自覺多少偏重似然性取向  
  
96  
00:05:31.002 --> 00:05:32.170  
That sort of of.  
儘管並非特意  
卻不自覺多少偏重在似然性取向  
  
97  
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.635  
>> It comes across  
a little bit [INAUDIBLE].  
的確是有點  
  
98  
00:05:33.635 --> 00:05:35.130  
Yeah.  
I noticed a little bit.  
我有注意到  
  
99  
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.400  
Yes and either that obeys for  
對我來說特別重要的是  
  
100  
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.670  
me a big issue was how you deal  
with non-significant results.  
如何解讀非顯著的統計分析結果  
  
101  
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.090  
because in my field, non-significant  
results were often used [INAUDIBLE].  
因為在我的領域中  
常使用非顯著結果做統計推論  
  
102  
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.340  
My field being unconscious knowledge,  
unconscious perception, and  
我的研究主題是無意識的(知識)與知覺  
  
103  
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.970  
perceived learning and how you establish  
perception is unconscious, subliminal.  
以及在無意識或潛意識下的學習與感知  
  
104  
00:05:54.970 --> 00:06:02.664  
Or learning is implicit is often by  
getting a non-significant result.  
還有隱性學習的研究經常出現非顯著的統計結果  
  
105  
00:06:02.664 --> 00:06:05.710  
And but just getting  
a non-significant result in itself  
如果只是報告這些非顯著的結果  
  
106  
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.810  
does not have evidential value,  
so what do you do?  
證據就沒有有足夠說服力  
那麼該怎麼辦呢?  
  
107  
00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.182  
So I was looking looking at light and  
bayes.  
所以我轉向運用貝式統計  
  
108  
00:06:11.182 --> 00:06:16.420  
And then just through having to  
really apply them in real situations.  
我試著應用貝式統計在實際的研究中  
  
109  
00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:22.830  
Not is about statistics but  
do psychology and apply those techniques.  
不只是應用其統計方式  
還運用這些技術在心理學研究過程  
  
110  
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.890  
I found bayes was just most useful.  
我發現貝式統計是最實用的  
  
111  
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:28.490  
Because typically when you have a theory,  
you're saying,  
特別是當你有一個理論時  
  
112  
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.410  
well there's a range of possibilities for  
what the population hypothesis could be,  
假設成立的機率會落在一個可能的區間範圍  
  
113  
00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.730  
some are more plausible than others.  
某些機率值可能較其他值更合理些  
  
114  
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.850  
And as soon as you accept that and  
一旦你有這樣的想法  
  
115  
00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.260  
want to get evidence from the hypothesis  
you'll have to base factors.  
下一步就是找出足夠的證明支持假設  
進而得到理論的基礎因子  
  
116  
00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.160  
And I've just found that  
enormously helpful.  
而我發現貝式定理在這個情況下特別有用  
  
117  
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.266  
If you look at how I write papers now  
even compared to three years ago,  
拿我現在寫的研究報告與三年前相比  
  
118  
00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:51.503  
it's just radically different.  
你會發現它們相當的不同  
  
119  
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.020  
I look back to how I read papers,  
really just bear in mind,  
而我重新回首讀過的研究報告  
  
120  
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.970  
just following through the logic  
that's contained in that book, but  
只是這次完全跟隨著我書中所闡述的邏輯  
  
121  
00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.140  
just following it through and actually  
applying it every step of the way.  
一步一步地用貝氏統計方法閱讀報告  
  
122  
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.160  
It's turned around how I do science.  
書中闡述的我如何改變做科學的方式  
  
123  
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:09.070  
So you'd say you're still  
learning about this book.  
所以你意思是說  
你至今仍在持續學習  
  
124  
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.800  
Looked into yourself.  
並省思自己做科學的方式  
  
125  
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.840  
Still learning, exactly.  
是的，持續學習  
  
126  
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.260  
So since 2008,  
when the book was published,  
自從這本書在2008年出版之後  
  
127  
00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.470  
I've been thinking about how to  
actually apply it in real situations.  
我便一直在思考能夠實際應用的例子  
  
128  
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.890  
So exactly the same logic that's in there,  
一個能夠應用書中介紹的邏輯方法  
  
129  
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.990  
but putting it into practice  
is what I've been working on.  
將其應用在實際研究上的例子  
  
130  
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.830  
All right, great.  
好的  
  
131  
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.497  
Thanks so much.  
謝謝你  
  
132  
00:07:24.497 --> 00:07:30.049
