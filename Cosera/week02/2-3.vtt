[MUSIC]  
[貝氏思維]  
  
2  
00:00:08.827 --> 00:00:12.270  
Now in the previous lecture  
we talked about Bayesian statistics.  
前一講談如何正確運用貝氏統計方法　　  
  
3  
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.078  
Formally quantifying your prior belief  
計量收集資料前相信的真實數值    
  
4  
00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:18.433  
updating it based on data  
into a posterior belief.  
並根據手上資料調整原先的信念　　  
  
5  
00:00:18.433 --> 00:00:21.733  
There's some debate in the literature  
about whether people should always use  
許多學者為了該不該使用貝氏統計打筆戰    
  
6  
00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:22.990  
Bayesian statistics or not.  
許多學者為了該不該使用貝氏統計打筆戰    
  
7  
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.625  
Depends on how happy you are with  
incorporating mainly subjective  
爭論重點是要如何將主觀的事前信念納入統計推論  
  
8  
00:00:27.625 --> 00:00:31.441  
prior information into your  
statistical reasoning.  
爭論重點是要如何將主觀的事前信念納入統計推論  
  
9  
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:36.346  
Here I want to talk a little bit about how  
it's important to at least use Bayesian  
這一講要分享一個有時候能派上用場的貝氏統計小技巧    
  
10  
00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:38.214  
statistics some of the time.  
這一講要分享一個有時候能派上用場的貝氏統計小技巧    
  
11  
00:00:38.214 --> 00:00:42.182  
Even if you don't want to formally  
quantify it to think about statistical  
即使你不會使用正規的貝氏統計推論流程    
  
12  
00:00:42.182 --> 00:00:43.270  
inferences.  
即使你不會使用正規的貝氏統計推論流程    
  
13  
00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.580  
So even if you don't want to quantify  
your inferences using a subjective prior  
或者不想在推論過程中摻入主觀事前信念    
  
14  
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.940  
it's going to keep prior information  
into account in some way.  
這方法能讓你在結論裡合理地整合事前信念    
  
15  
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.230  
Now taking prior probabilities into  
account is very often smart thinking.  
某些例子中考慮事前機率能讓人豁然開朗    
  
16  
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.210  
We can look at an example  
from medical science  
像以下要談的醫學研究案例    
  
17  
00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.640  
to see the point of thinking about priors.  
就是運用事前資訊突破盲點     
  
18  
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.060  
Now  
of the people in the population are sick.  
這個案例探討有種疾病在一群人之中的罹病率是3%  
  
19  
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.440  
We have a test that can identify  
whether you have this illness or not  
要開發一種能篩選真正罹患此病的測試    
  
20  
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.610  
and this is correct 80% of the time.  
而這個測試的篩選正確率是80%    
  
21  
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.300  
So this equals a statistical power of 80%.  
也就是統計考驗力是80%    
  
22  
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.480  
In 80% of the cases where you are sick  
實際意義是測試結果為陽性的一群個案    
  
23  
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.510  
the test will tell you that  
you are actually sick.  
其中80%是真的有生病    
  
24  
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.790  
Of course we also have  
a type one error rate.  
當然別忘了型一錯誤率(偽陽率)    
  
25  
00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.890  
And we've seen that in medical science  
如同上一週談到的醫學研究案例    
  
26  
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.510  
this is often a little bit higher just  
to be sure  
型一錯誤率通常設定較高，避免發生憾事    
  
27  
00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.480  
So in this example  
there's a 13% false positive rate.  
這個案例的偽陽率有13%    
  
28  
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.630  
Or  
don't have this illness  
也就是說有13%的陽性反應個案並沒有生病  
  
29  
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.500  
will be identified by  
the test as maybe being sick.  
卻被診斷成可能有生病  
  
30  
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.770  
If you get the test and  
there's a positive result  
就算測試結果是陽性    
  
31  
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.430  
remember positive result in a test  
in medicine is not very positive.  
要記得不一定是真正的陽性    
  
32  
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.070  
It means that you've been identified  
as you might have an illness.  
只是說現在的你有可能患病    
  
33  
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.939  
Given a positive test result  
is it that a patient is actually sick?  
根據實際的陽性結果，有多少被篩選出來的患者是真的生病    
    
34  
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.060  
Now let's visualize this by looking  
at a large population of individuals.  
這個問題能用視覺化的方式來理解    
  
35  
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.270  
And in this population  
we see that about 3% of the individuals  
這一群人之中大約有3%是患病的    
  
36  
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.060  
the red ones in the corner  
are actually sick.  
左上角的紅色小人是真正的患者    
  
37  
00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.140  
They actually have this illness.  
應該要被診斷出來    
  
38  
00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.900  
And it means that 97% of the people  
are not sick to begin with.  
反過來說97%的人並沒有患病  
  
39  
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.620  
So this is a situation where  
the prior probability of being sick  
醫生會認為對診斷出罹患此病的事前機率是非常低的  
  
40  
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.580  
is actually quite low.  
醫生會認為對診斷出罹患此病的事前機率是非常低的  
  
41  
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.110  
And then we collect some data  
we perform a test.  
為確定診斷的正確性而收集一些資料  
  
42  
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.811  
And in this test we see that a number  
of individuals are identified as  
收集到的資料顯示這些個案有陽性反應    
(綠色方框內)  
  
43  
00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:37.881  
having a specific sickness.  
收集到的資料顯示這些個案有陽性反應    
(綠色方框內)  
  
44  
00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:41.366  
Now  
actually have this sickness  
其中四人是真正的患者    
  
45  
00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:46.463  
we can see that we had an 80% probability  
of exactly determining that they had this.  
記得一開始提到這道測試的結果有80%的正確率  
  
46  
00:02:46.463 --> 00:02:50.405  
So  
the statistical power was 80%  
也就是有80%的真陽率或統計考驗力  
  
47  
00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:55.197  
which means that four out of these five  
will be correctly identified as being ill.  
診斷出有陽性反應的五人裡有四人是真正患病    
  
48  
00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:59.543  
But we also had this large false  
positive probability of 13%.  
但是也要注意偽陽率高達13%    
  
49  
00:02:59.543 --> 00:03:04.770  
So we see that in this cluster of  
individuals there's actually quite a large  
因為高偽陽率，被誤診為患者的人數  
  
50  
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.334  
number of people that are identified as  
maybe being ill based on a type one error.  
比真正生病的人更多    
  
51  
00:03:10.334 --> 00:03:12.726  
So  
that we have observed  
那麼根據手上的實際資料  
  
52  
00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:14.968  
what is now the probability  
of actually being ill?  
如何計算確診的機率?  
  
53  
00:03:14.968 --> 00:03:18.527  
And we can see that this is just  
the probability of being one of the red  
這裡可以用真正患者的比例    
  
54  
00:03:18.527 --> 00:03:22.540  
individuals  
of one of the black individuals.  
與未患病者的比例相除得知      
    
55  
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.070  
We can also formally quantify this.  
這可以用貝氏定理做詳細計算    
  
56  
00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.630  
So  
就像前一講所做過的    
  
57  
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.700  
we have the prior times the likelihood  
which equals the posterior distribution.  
把事前機率比乘上似然性比，就能獲得事後機率分配    
  
58  
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.085  
In this case it means that before we  
started  
這個例子裡參與測試的個案共有175人  
  
59  
00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:44.210  
on this slide  
ill to begin with  
其中有5位真正患者，其餘170人健康(事前機率)    
  
60  
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.860  
Then we have the data  
correctly identified as being sick and  
診斷為陽性的個案中有四位來自五位真正的患者  
(確診的似然值)  
  
61  
00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.440  
22 out of 170 were identified  
as maybe being sick.  
其它22位是屬於170位健康人士  
(誤診的似然值)  
  
62  
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.862  
But these were all false positives.  
但是這22位是偽陽性的    
(誤診的似然值)  
  
63  
00:03:55.862 --> 00:03:59.167  
And if we combine this  
then calculate the posterior probability  
事先機率乘上似然性比，算出確診的事後機率  
  
64  
00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:01.889  
we actually see that it's based  
on the outcome of the test.  
因為這是根據實際資料計算得出    
  
65  
00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.083  
Now only 18% likely that  
you're actually ill.  
可知實際的確診率是18%  
  
66  
00:04:06.083 --> 00:04:08.228  
So this probability is surprisingly low.  
這比原先預期的80%要低很多  
  
67  
00:04:08.228 --> 00:04:12.870  
And we see that many medical doctors  
overestimate the probability that someone  
一種疾病的確診患者越少，許多醫生傾向高估患病機率  
  
68  
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.520  
is really sick  
illness is very low in the population.  
一種疾病的確診患者越少，許多醫生傾向高估患病機率  
  
69  
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.020  
So at least some implicit  
Bayesian statistics is useful.  
由此可見貝氏統計多少起了作用    
  
70  
00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.440  
Realizing that if something is pretty  
rare to begin with a positive test result  
即使得知診斷出陽性結果的比例偏低    
  
71  
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.560  
might not tell you so much yet and  
follow up tests are definitely required.  
也無法得知診斷正確的機率。    
這時就需要以下介紹的統計方法。    
    
72  
00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.170  
So taking prior information into  
account can lead to better inferences.  
納入事前資訊有助統計推論    
  
  
73  
00:04:37.318 --> 00:04:41.561  
I'll show you a very intuitive way to  
do this when you're thinking about P  
如果你想利用結果的p值更新你對研究問題的信念    
  
  
74  
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:45.813  
values and when you're using P values  
to more or less update your belief.  
我要介紹的方法對你會有很大的幫助    
  
  
75  
00:04:45.813 --> 00:04:47.908  
Now P values were not meant to do this.  
雖然p值不是為此目的而設計    
  
  
76  
00:04:47.908 --> 00:04:53.541  
But there are some statistics that point  
out an easy approach to give you the most  
有些簡易的統計方法能根據手上的p值  
  
  
77  
00:04:53.541 --> 00:04:59.120  
likely posterior probability of the  
hypothesis being true  
估計假設為真的事後機率  
  
  
78  
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.153  
And again  
Bayesian statistics  
再次提醒，這不是正統的貝氏統計    
  
  
79  
00:05:02.153 --> 00:05:06.359  
it's a very easy way to at least use  
a little bit of Bayesian thinking.    
只是一種運用貝氏思維的簡易方法    
  
    
80  
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.230  
Now this is known as normal  
crum this graph that we have.  
這是Held(2010)提出的列線圖(nomogram)  
  
  
81  
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:17.092  
And there are three vertical lines  
one in the left  
圖中由左至右有三個垂直軸    
  
82  
00:05:17.092 --> 00:05:18.276  
one in the right.  
圖中由左至右有三個垂直軸    
  
83  
00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:22.808  
This type of graph is very often  
used in medical institutions.  
許多醫護實務常常使用列線圖    
  
84  
00:05:22.808 --> 00:05:24.096  
Where for example  
例如專業護理師看到有人咳嗽，需要計算這人是感冒還是感染伊波拉病毒的機率    
  
85  
00:05:24.096 --> 00:05:29.038  
nurses cannot be expected to perform  
formal Bayesian statistics on the fly.  
例如專業護理師看到有人咳嗽，需要計算這人是感冒還是感染伊波拉病毒的機率    
  
86  
00:05:29.038 --> 00:05:33.142  
When they see someone cough and  
want to think about the probability  
例如專業護理師看到有人咳嗽，需要計算這人是感冒還是感染伊波拉病毒的機率    
  
87  
00:05:33.142 --> 00:05:37.108  
that this person is either just  
having the flu or having Ebola.  
但是通常很難做貝氏統計分析    
  
88  
00:05:37.108 --> 00:05:41.327  
But using a graph like this can very  
easily give you some indication of  
只要有事前機率與收集好的資料    
  
89  
00:05:41.327 --> 00:05:44.091  
the posterior probability of a hypothesis  
使用列線圖可以很快檢驗假設是否為真的事後機率    
  
90  
00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:47.530  
given a prior probability and  
an observed test result.  
使用列線圖可以很快檢驗假設是否為真的事後機率    
  
91  
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.060  
Now  
最左邊的垂直軸列出虛無假設為真的事前機率    
  
92  
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.500  
we see the prior probability that  
the null hypothesis is true.  
最左邊的垂直軸列出虛無假設為真的事前機率    
  
93  
00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:59.590  
In the middle graph we see the P value  
that we've observed and on the right  
中間的垂直軸列出從資料算出的任何p值  
  
94  
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.450  
we can get the posterior probability  
that the null hypothesis is true.  
連接兩軸上的兩個點就能找到虛無假設為真的事後機率    
  
95  
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:09.660  
Now let's start by thinking of a situation  
where before we collect some data  
假想收集資料前，只能假設患者確實患病的機率是50%    
  
96  
00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.250  
think that anything goes  
a person might be sick or not  
假想收集資料前，只能假設患者確實患病的機率是50%    
  
97  
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:16.190  
both of these are 50% probable.  
假想收集資料前，只能假設患者確實患病的機率是50%    
  
98  
00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.750  
So here I've pointed an arrow at the 50%  
所以在最左方垂直軸的50%做記號    
(在Excel的B2欄輸入0.5)  
  
99  
00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.640  
prior probability that  
the null hypothesis is true.  
代表虛無假設為真的事前機率    
(在Excel的B2欄輸入0.5)  
  
100  
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.260  
We collect some data and  
再配合從資料得到的p值就能升級患病機率的評估    
  
101  
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.383  
then let's try to quickly use  
this graph to update our belief.  
再配合從資料得到的p值就能升級患病機率的評估    
  
102  
00:06:30.383 --> 00:06:35.993  
In this case we collected some data and  
we found a P value of 0.05.  
假如說得到的p值剛好是0.05  
  
  
103  
00:06:35.993 --> 00:06:39.554  
So  
of statistical significance  
剛好是一般統計顯著水準，這個結果恰好達到顯著      
  
  
104  
00:06:39.554 --> 00:06:42.934  
we got lucky it's just exactly  
statistically significant.  
剛好是一般統計顯著水準，這個結果恰好達到顯著      
  
  
105  
00:06:42.934 --> 00:06:46.483  
But as many people who practice  
Bayesian statistics will tell you  
不過任何懂貝氏統計的朋友都會告訴你    
  
106  
00:06:46.483 --> 00:06:48.660  
such as a high P value  
如此高的p值就算當做顯著結果  
  
107  
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.911  
even though it's statistically significant  
is actually not a lot of evidence.  
還是不能做為真正的證據    
  
108  
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:54.969  
And this graph nicely illustrates this.  
這是只要在列線圖畫出一條線  
  
109  
00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:59.315  
If you had a 50% prior belief  
that the null hypothesis is true  
這條線連接50%的事先機率    
  
110  
00:06:59.315 --> 00:07:01.061  
you collected some data.  
與資料分析得到的p值    
  
111  
00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:07.935  
Then on the right  
line hits the vertical axis is actually  
延伸到最右邊的垂直軸上標示29%的點  
  
112  
00:07:07.935 --> 00:07:14.509  
at about 29% posterior probability  
that the null hypothesis is true.  
而這就是虛無假設為真的事後機率    
  
113  
00:07:14.509 --> 00:07:18.859  
So we started out with a prior belief  
that it was 50% likely that the null  
小結一下：一開始虛無假設為真的事前機率是50%    
  
114  
00:07:18.859 --> 00:07:20.135  
hypothesis is true.  
小結一下：一開始虛無假設為真的事前機率是50%    
  
115  
00:07:20.135 --> 00:07:24.605  
We observe some data and find a barely  
statistically significant P value.  
然而收集資料後獲得剛好顯著的p值    
  
116  
00:07:24.605 --> 00:07:28.388  
And then of course it make sense that our  
prior belief that the null hypothesis is  
通常都會得到比事前預估低一些的事後機率    
  
117  
00:07:28.388 --> 00:07:30.180  
true is a little bit lower.  
通常都會得到比事前預估低一些的事後機率    
  
118  
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.350  
But you see that it's not a lot lower.  
但是這個例子得到的事後機率實在不夠低    
  
119  
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:36.160  
It's actually still 29% likely  
that the null hypothesis is true  
以分析得到的p值為0.05來看  
  
120  
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.454  
even though we've observed  
the P value of 0.05.  
實際是虛無假設為真的機率還有29%  
  
121  
00:07:39.454 --> 00:07:44.130  
Now this is one of these ways in  
which you can use Bayesian thinking  
這個案例顯示貝氏思維能在p值無法提供充分判斷時  
  
122  
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.290  
to at least acknowledge that  
a relatively high P value doesn't  
這個案例顯示貝氏思維能在p值無法提供充分判斷時  
  
  
123  
00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.929  
mean that the null hypothesis  
is now completely unlikely.  
能提供補充證據或說明    
    
124  
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.140  
Let's say that you had the same prior  
belief  
再來看這個案例，事前機率也是50%  
  
125  
00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:58.814  
much lower P value of 0.001.  
不過p值是0.001  
  
126  
00:07:58.814 --> 00:08:02.590  
In this case we can see that  
the point where this line  
這個例子畫出來的線連接到最右邊的2%  
  
127  
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.480  
hits the right axis is around 2%.  
這個例子畫出來的線連接到最右邊的2%  
  
128  
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.560  
So  
因為這筆資料的證據力較強    
  
129  
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.980  
we now have a prior belief that  
the null hypothesis is true of only 2%.  
可以得知虛無假設確實為真的機率只有2%    
  
130  
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:13.790  
So that's a huge drop  
前後兩個案例的差別如此之大  
  
131  
00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:18.130  
we started out with the 50% prior belief  
that the null hypothesis might be true.  
雖然虛無假設為真的事前機率都是50%  
  
132  
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.091  
We collect data and  
收集資料後確知虛無假為真的機率只有2%    
  
133  
00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:22.585  
now we think it's only 2% likely  
that the null hypothesis is true.  
收集資料後確知虛無假為真的機率只有2%    
  
134  
00:08:22.585 --> 00:08:25.160  
So we've learned quite a lot.  
至此你應該知道這張圖的用處  
  
135  
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.719  
Now we can also used this graph in  
a very interesting way to think okay  
運用在你自己的研究裡    
  
136  
00:08:29.719 --> 00:08:32.347  
so what about hypothesis that a priori  
只要在收集資料前評估假設為真的事前機率    
  
137  
00:08:32.347 --> 00:08:36.540  
before I collected some data I  
found really unlikely to be true.  
只要在收集資料前評估假設為真的事前機率    
  
138  
00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.200  
Now it's always a bit tricky  
we're talking about subjective belief.  
不過這需要一些技巧，因為通常只有主觀機率    
  
139  
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.160  
So what is an unlikely hypothesis?  
那麼能不能從最不可能為真的假設下手？    
  
140  
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.850  
At least sometimes people in  
the literature will identify  
至少可從文獻中找到最不可能發現的結果    
(這段談話呼應第三週Dan Simons訪談篇)  
  
141  
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.460  
surprising results themselves.  
至少可從文獻中找到最不可能發現的結果    
(這段談話呼應第三週Dan Simons訪談篇)  
  
142  
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.480  
They say we published this result and  
this is a very surprising finding.  
如果有研究者成功發表一些震驚全球的發現  
(這段談話呼應第三週Dan Simons訪談篇)  
  
143  
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.770  
So that means that before they started  
至少代表在收集資料前  
(這段談話呼應第三週Dan Simons訪談篇)  
  
144  
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.970  
it was at least less likely to be true  
than it was likely to be true.  
假設不為真比假設為真的可能性更低  
(這段談話呼應第三週Dan Simons訪談篇)  
  
145  
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:00.570  
We're not at 50  
所以事機率不會是50%  
(這段談話呼應第三週Dan Simons訪談篇)  
  
146  
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.280  
but the prior probability that a null  
hypothesis was true was somewhat higher.  
因此虛無假設為真的機率也許會比較高    
(這段談話呼應第三週Dan Simons訪談篇)  
  
147  
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:10.960  
Let's put this prior belief at about 75%  
sounds about fair.  
現在把事前機率提高到75%  
  
148  
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:15.250  
So we have 75% probability that the null  
hypothesis is true before we start.  
表示收集資料前相信虛無假設有75%的機率為真    
  
149  
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.810  
We're slightly skeptical  
that something is going on.  
因為我們懷疑能得到預期結果的可能性    
  
150  
00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:23.370  
We again collect some data and  
we find a P value of 0.05.  
分析收集的資料得到的p值也是0.05    
  
151  
00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.850  
Then the line continues on to the axis  
on the right and again  
直線連接到最右邊的垂直軸  
  
152  
00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:33.670  
the minimum posterior probability  
that the null hypothesis is true.  
卻發現連接到軸線的上限之外    
  
153  
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:38.499  
And you see because we started with 75%  
prior probability that the null hypothesis  
這個例子的結論可以說根據虛無假設為真的機率有75%  
  
154  
00:09:38.499 --> 00:09:41.900  
is true  
we observe a just significant result.  
以及剛好達到顯著水準的結果  
  
155  
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.140  
But after this  
it's actually still more likely  
實際上虛無假設為真的機率遠高於對立假設為真的機率  
  
156  
00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:49.270  
that the null hypothesis is true than  
the alternative hypothesis is true.  
實際上虛無假設為真的機率遠高於對立假設為真的機率  
  
157  
00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.230  
So this is an interesting observation.  
這樣的結論非常具有啟發性  
  
158  
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:54.360  
If though we observe  
a statistically significant result  
即使獲得統計顯著的結果    
  
159  
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.720  
because beforehand this result was  
actually very  
因為事前已確信極不可能獲得肯定的證據    
  
160  
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.263  
After collecting the data  
we are still not convinced.  
實際的資料也顯示不可確信  
  
161  
00:10:02.263 --> 00:10:07.268  
So this is an easy way without very formal  
Bayesian statistics to at least give  
演繹這種方法讓你知道不需要會做貝氏統計  
  
162  
00:10:07.268 --> 00:10:11.973  
you a rough estimates of the best case  
scenario for the null hypothesis.  
也能大略估計虛無假設為真的真實機率    
  
163  
00:10:11.973 --> 00:10:15.615  
Which might actually not be very  
good based on very high P values.  
特別是無法相信高p值的時候    
  
164  
00:10:17.555 --> 00:10:20.303  
This is inline with a claim by Laplace  
這正是數學家拉普拉斯(Laplace)曾說過的  
  
165  
00:10:20.303 --> 00:10:26.140  
who says that extraordinary claims  
require extraordinary evidence.  
驚人的結論需要驚天的證據  
  
166  
00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.210  
So very high P values in a situation where  
高p值的結果通常有這種特性    
  
167  
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.150  
we think that the hypothesis  
is extremely unlikely.  
結果所支持的假設通常最不可能為真  
  
168  
00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:34.737  
Think about things like precognition.  
想想超感知覺的案例    
  
169  
00:10:34.737 --> 00:10:37.040  
Do you think that precognition is true or not?  
你認為真的有超感知覺存在嗎?  
  
170  
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:40.625  
Well  
belief that it is possible.  
也許你或多或少相信真的存在  
  
171  
00:10:40.625 --> 00:10:45.338  
But you don't think that it's extremely  
likely to be true otherwise we would have  
但是多數人還是不相信為真，否則今天我們會看到大量支持原始研究的論文  
  
172  
00:10:45.338 --> 00:10:47.263  
seen some evidence for it by now.  
但是多數人還是不相信為真，否則今天我們會看到大量支持原始研究的論文  
  
173  
00:10:47.263 --> 00:10:51.480  
So your prior belief that  
precognition is real is pretty low.  
所以多數人相信超感知覺存在的信念還是很低  
  
174  
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.035  
Or in other words  
that the null hypothesis that there is  
也就是說多數人相信無超感知覺存在的虛無假設之信念非常高    
  
175  
00:10:56.035 --> 00:11:00.246  
no precognition  
your belief is very high.  
也就是說多數人相信無超感知覺存在的虛無假設之信念非常高    
  
176  
00:11:00.246 --> 00:11:04.509  
So if you want to show that there is  
indeed something like precognition then  
你若要改變世人對超感知覺的看法    
  
177  
00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:07.203  
you need to provide  
extraordinary evidence.  
就要提出真正驚天動地的證據    
  
178  
00:11:07.203 --> 00:11:13.805  
Extremely compelling data that will  
lead you to slowly update your belief.  
只是要改變信念必須要不斷收集資料    
    
179  
00:11:13.805 --> 00:11:18.324  
Now in this lecture I've talked about how  
you can use Bayesian thinking even when  
這一講介紹不需要熟悉貝氏統計也能運用貝氏思維在統計推論中的技巧    
  
180  
00:11:18.324 --> 00:11:22.593  
you don't want to use formal Bayesian  
statistics when report your results.  
這一講介紹不需要熟悉貝氏統計也能運用貝氏思維在統計推論中的技巧    
  
181  
00:11:22.593 --> 00:11:26.368  
Do you prefer to use frequentist  
statistics for example and  
即使你是次數主義的鐵粉    
  
182  
00:11:26.368 --> 00:11:29.463  
you don't want to quantify  
your prior belief and  
你不想計量預期結果的事前信念    
  
183  
00:11:29.463 --> 00:11:32.802  
update it based on the data  
into a posterior belief.  
也不想更新事後信念  
  
184  
00:11:32.802 --> 00:11:36.383  
It still makes sense to use  
a little bit of Bayesian thinking.  
貝氏思維技巧是有些用處    
  
185  
00:11:36.383 --> 00:11:42.177  
To keep in mind how likely the hypothesis  
was before the data was collected and  
切記只要了解假設為真的事前機率  
  
186  
00:11:42.177 --> 00:11:47.544  
weigh the evidence in relation to  
the extraordinariness of the claim.  
能評估研究結果是不是驚天證據  
  
187  
00:11:47.544 --> 00:11:52.089
