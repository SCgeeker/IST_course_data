理論的建構

2
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.750
In this lecture, we'll talk about theory construction.
這一講談的是理論的建構

3
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.010
In most of the course, we talked about statistical inferences,
之前大部分課程都是談根據資料做統計推論

4
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.590
drawing inferences from data.
之前大部分課程都是談根據資料做統計推論

5
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.120
But of course, what we really want to know is whether your theory is true or
不過做研究都是要知道理論能不能正確預測結果

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.440
not and can predict something.
不過做研究都是要知道理論能不能正確預測結果

7
00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.600
Generating a good theory is difficult, and
建構好理論不是容易的事

8
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.060
it depends a little bit on the specific research area are you working.
需要依靠個人在特定領域的研究心得

9
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.350
But we can give some general recommendations.
接著我會給一些廣泛性的建議

10
00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.249
Now in most of this course we've been talking about statistical hypothesis and
我們已經談了很多統計假設與推論的方法

11
00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:39.210
drawing statistical inferences.
我們已經談了很多統計假設與推論的方法

12
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.520
But as a researcher of course what you want to do is draw theoretical inferences.
不過研究者最想做的是理論推測

13
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.560
To do this, you of course first have to have a good theory
首先當然是有一個好理論

14
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.340
that you can use to create a statistical hypothesis.
再根據理論創造統計假設

15
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.770
So we see that statistical inferences and
因此統計推論

16
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.600
theory generation are basically two sides of the same coin.
和理論建的建構可說是一體兩面

17
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.280
A scientific theory is a set of testable statements about the relation between
科學理論是根據資料的可證宣言集合

18
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.520
observations.
科學理論是根據資料的可證宣言集合

19
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.690
And whenever we collect data, we do so
只要手上有合適的資料

20
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.294
with the goal to test some of these statements, to try to make an inference
目的就是檢驗這些宣言，藉此推論

21
00:01:08.294 --> 00:01:11.080
about whether the theory has good predictive power or not.
理論是否有充分的預測能力

22
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.420
Now we focus a lot on testing these theories but
之前談的都是理論的檢驗

23
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.740
not a lot of theory construction.
較少談理論的建構

24
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.850
This is an important topic in itself.
建構本身就是一個重要主題

25
00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.830
Sometimes more difficult to teach.
有些內容難以言傳

26
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.670
But it's really important to keep in mind that theories are really what's driving
然而理論是驅動科學家做研究的重要目標

27
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.060
the goal of doing research.
然而理論是驅動科學家做研究的重要目標

28
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.500
I'll give some suggestions on how to come up with good
以下提供如何提出良好理論預測的建議

29
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.660
ideas to generate theoretical predictions.
以下提供如何提出良好理論預測的建議

30
00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.362
Some of these are based on this book, Theory Construction and
一些是出自投影片裡的這本書

31
00:01:37.362 --> 00:01:38.300
Model-Building Skills,
一些是出自投影片裡的這本書

32
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.900
which focuses a lot on how to do this within the social sciences.
這本書談很多社會科學理論的建構

33
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.230
So if you're interested in this topic,
如果你對此主題有興趣

34
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.140
I would highly recommend that you take a look at this book.
建議找這本書來讀一讀

35
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.740
So which approaches can we use?
要怎麼給你建議呢？

36
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.640
One used approach in science is to come up with a thought experiment.
一種方式是進行思想實驗

37
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.460
A very well known thought experiment is done by Einstein when he asks himself,
愛因斯坦曾提出一則著名的思想實驗

38
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.900
what would you see if you could travel at the speed of light?
若我能以光速前進，會看到什麼呢？

39
00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.930
So by coming up with this though experiment and thinking about what would
由你來做這思想實驗的話，會預期發生什麼事？

40
00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.450
happen, you can create theoretical predictions that are testable.
你能想到任何可測試的理論預測嗎？

41
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.300
Another approach that we use in the social sciences is sometimes
社會科學建構理論的另一個方式

42
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.620
to rely on your personal experiences.
是從個人經驗取材

43
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.870
What happens to you, and can you come up with a theoretical prediction based
你能夠從週遭的人事物發現可行的理論預測嗎？

44
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.150
on something that someone tells you?
你能夠從週遭的人事物發現可行的理論預測嗎？

45
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.610
One example is Stanley Milgram's mother.
有個例子來自Stanley Milgram的岳母

46
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.670
Over dinner, she complained that nobody in public transport would give up their seats
有天吃晚餐時，她抱怨坐公車時沒人讓座給她

47
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.040
if she entered the public bus.
有天吃晚餐時，她抱怨坐公車時沒人讓座給她

48
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.180
So Stanley Milgram was interested in the social norms in cities and
Milgram因此好奇大城市裡人們的行為常態

49
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.930
he looked at whether people would actually give up their seats depending on how you
想了解是不是對乘客提出要求
就會有人讓座

50
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.090
asked these questions.
想了解是不是對乘客提出要求
就會有人讓座

51
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.260
He found the 56% of the people actually would give up their seat if you
他研究後發現有56%的乘客會在知道要求後會讓座

52
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.800
nicely asked.
他研究後發現有56%的乘客會在知道要求後會讓座

53
00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.070
Another approach is to try to empathize with other people.
還有一種方式是發揮對他人的同理心

54
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.120
Put yourself in someone else's shoes and
如同諺語“給自己穿上別人的鞋子”

55
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.620
think, what drives the behavior of this individual?
理解他人行為之後的想法

56
00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.510
In psychology, a well known example of this is the question,
心理學的一個著名案例是

57
00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.210
how it is possible that people who worked in concentration camps did what they did?
探討人們在集中營裡生活和工作的行為模式

58
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.960
This inspired a lot of theory development on authority, for example.
這個案例促成權威理論的發展

59
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.240
You can also use observations.
觀察也是建構理論的方式

60
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.650
Let's say you go out and you buy a car and
像是出門買汽車

61
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.200
you look at the car salesman, what do these people do to sell you a car?
你可以觀察銷售員如何與你互動

62
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.940
What kind of ticks do they use and how can this inform you about persuasion and
他們用什麼技巧打動你
脫服你買車

63
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.059
theories about how to make
more persuasive arguments?
想想有什麼理論能預測有說服力的說法？

64
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.560
Another approach we often use is to rely on metaphors.
科學家也會利用隱喻建構理論

65
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.490
Now a metaphor should never be a replacement of an existing theory, but
隱喻雖然不能完全取代理論

66
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.090
it can be used to inspire theoretical reasoning.
但是能引起理論的思考

67
00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.410
In memory research,
拿記憶研究來說

68
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.810
one of the theoretical models is the model of memory like a storage bin.
有種理論假設記憶像儲藏盒

69
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.270
Whatever you put in last in a storage bin is also most easily retrieved.
最後放進去的最容易被拿出來

70
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.682
So one theoretical prediction based on this metaphorical line of reasoning
有個參考這種隱喻的理論

71
00:03:54.682 --> 00:03:59.290
could be, is it also the case in human memory that whatever we store last is most
預測最後記憶的資訊是最容易提取的

72
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.040
easily retrieved?
預測最後記憶的資訊是最容易提取的

73
00:04:02.165 --> 00:04:05.470
What's always a good idea as a scientist is to ask why and
很多資深科學家建議找問題要保持赤子之心

74
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.440
how like a three year old.
很多資深科學家建議找問題要保持赤子之心

75
00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.290
Don't take anything for granted.
不要存先入為主的想法

76
00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.200
When you read about theories in the literature,
閱讀文獻中談到的理論

77
00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.140
always ask, why would this be the case?
要不斷地問，為什麼是這樣子

78
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.870
What's going on?
還能變成什麼樣？

79
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.490
What's the underlying mechanism?
有什麼潛在的機制？

80
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.550
And this can inspire new theoretical questions.
這些問法能引發新的理論觀點

81
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.050
Finally, a good idea is to have broad interest as a scientist.
最後的建議是保持廣泛的興趣

82
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.220
We see that many of the most ground breaking ideas come from
很多突破性的創見是來自

83
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.630
introducing ideas in other scientific disciplines into your own research line.
從其他科學領域引進的觀點

84
00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.290
You don't have to limit yourself to other scientific disciplines.
不要限制自己對其他科學領域的好奇心

85
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.350
You can also be inspired by movies or books or whatever you see and hear.
一部電影，一本書，任何聽聞都有可能帶來靈感

86
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.260
Now after you have generated some hypothesis and
建構理論預測之後

87
00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.080
some theory, it's good to try to formalize this theory and
最好儘可能將理論與預測模式化

88
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.680
this theoretical prediction as well as possible.
最好儘可能將理論與預測模式化

89
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:55.970
One idea is to use multiple modalities to do so.
可以使用各式各樣的媒介

90
00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.309
So you can use words to describe your theory, figures and numbers.
像是文字、圖像、數字都能做描述媒介

91
00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.620
For example, let's say we have the theoretical hypothesis that
例如有個理論假設

92
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.360
students are happier than teachers, but especially on hot days.
學生比老師的快樂感高，尤其是大熱天

93
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.440
The idea being that on these hot days, students are free to go out and
理論的說法是學生在大熱天能自由外出

94
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.490
enjoy the weather while teachers are,
但是老師卻要在室內改作業和備課等等

95
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.400
of course, working inside, preparing your next lecture or grading your assignments.
但是老師卻要在室內改作業和備課等等

96
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.930
So we can visualize this in the form of a simple graph.
這樣的預測可以用簡單的圖像表達

97
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.850
We can have a statistical hypothesis saying that this is ANOVA and
像是一個用ANOVA檢驗交互作用的統計假設

98
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.770
we should find an interaction.
像是一個用ANOVA檢驗交互作用的統計假設

99
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.560
Or you can even try to specify the numbers that you expect to observe in each of
或者設定兩種天氣的老師和學生的平均感受值

100
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.949
the conditions in this design.
或者設定兩種天氣的老師和學生的平均感受值

101
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.510
When you define your theoretical prediction, it's always good to
設定理論預測時

102
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.520
think about the boundary conditions of the effect that you predict.
設定理論預測的可行情境是有幫助的

103
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:45.410
It's very rare, at least in psychology,
至少在心理學

104
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.010
to have a universal theory of some sort of effect.
很少有理論能預測所有可能的效果

105
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.210
There are always boundary conditions.
總是只有部分可行情境能被預測

106
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.980
You should not make statement that generalizes over
宣稱任何事都可預測是不切實際的

107
00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.169
everything that's possible.
宣稱任何事都可預測是不切實際的

108
00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.330
One thing you can try to do is think when would actually the opposite while
你可以試想有什麼情境是我的理論無法預測

109
00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:02.980
I'm predicting being true?
你可以試想有什麼情境是我的理論無法預測

110
00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.050
McGuire challenges readers to think about the situation that every proposition
McGuire給了這麼一道建議
請你想想在什麼情況下

111
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:14.930
is occasionally true, at least in certain contexts viewed from certain perspectives.
你的理論在那種觀點關注的脈絡中，
所有命題會是正確的

112
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.390
He calls this perspectivism.
這種想法稱為觀點主義

113
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.110
His idea is that it always depends.
中心思想是觀察事物所根據的觀點

114
00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.900
So whatever theory you have, it might be true, but
你現在想到的理論或許是對的

115
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.650
it always depends on certain context.
但只限在指定的脈絡中

116
00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.510
And he even goes as far as to say that the opposite
McGuire還指出在某些情況
與理論預測相反的結果也可能為真

117
00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:33.430
of any theoretical prediction is also true depending on situations.
McGuire還指出在某些情況
與理論預測相反的結果也可能為真

118
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.780
So try to define these boundary conditions in this context as well as possible when
所以設定可行情境的脈絡要儘可能

119
00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.200
you make a theoretical prediction.
與理論預測一致

120
00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.990
Fiedler distinguishes between two
parts in the scientific cycle.
Fiedler區別科學流程的兩個部分

121
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.670
A loosening stage, where we generate theoretical ideas, and
建構理論的寬鬆階段

122
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:54.440
a tightening stage where we select and test the best of these ideas.
以及選擇與測試理論的緊要階段

123
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.130
Now when we're in the loosening stage,
寬鬆階段時的思考

124
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:59.640
you have to create as much random variation as possible.
要儘可能地做發散式創造

125
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.590
Anything goes.
想出所有可能性

126
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.810
Whatever helps you to generate good theoretical ideas goes.
任可能建構理論預測的想法都可接受

127
00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:10.130
So you can play around with data, explore, come up with crazy ideas.
儘情地玩弄資料、探索與思考瘋狂的點子

128
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.770
And that's all fine.
都是可行的手段

129
00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.030
Only later in the tightening stage comes the part of the process where we think
稍後的緊要階段就要評估想出來的點子到底好不好？

130
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.660
okay, which of these IDs that we generated was actually good?
稍後的緊要階段就要評估想出來的點子到底好不好？

131
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.410
Which should we reject and which can we use to keep going?
那些要捨棄？那些可保留？

132
00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.620
You can think of what a theory would really imply,
最終版理論的預測內容

133
00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:31.550
come up with as many as possible ideas of what the theoretical prediction actually
要儘可能觸及在文獻中讀到的任何狀況

134
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.199
is when you read about something in the literature, for example.
要儘可能觸及在文獻中讀到的任何狀況

135
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.170
You can play around with methods.
你可以嘗試任何方法

136
00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:40.360
If you have some sort of measurement device,
要是你有某種測量工具

137
00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.150
try to use it in all sorts of different ways.
在各種可測量的狀況都試試看

138
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.330
You can also play around with data.
也可以嘗試各種探索資料的角度

139
00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:48.180
You might even simulate data to see what would happen
像是根據某種假設模擬資料

140
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:52.380
depending on specific assumptions, and then subsequently use the ideas that
歸納出可行的模擬結果

141
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:55.510
come from these simulations to test them on people.
再使用實際的樣本收集資料

142
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:58.490
Or you can explore existing data sets.
或者從已存在的資料挖掘

143
00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.480
Now of course we've talked about how exploring data sets can increase the type
之前已經提到很多探索資料會增加型一錯誤率的問題

144
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:03.590
one error rates.
之前已經提到很多探索資料會增加型一錯誤率的問題

145
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:06.240
But here, we're not talking about the testing stage,
但這不是理論的檢定

146
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.440
not the tightening stage of theory testing.
也不是建構理論的緊要階段

147
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.680
We're talking about generating ideas and anything goes.
建構理論時任何可行的方法都可接受

148
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.890
So if you look at data sets and you can come up with a very good
探索資料能有助發想好的理解預測

149
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.060
theoretical prediction, that's perfectly fine.
可以放手去做

150
00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:23.870
Of course, after generating this idea, you actually want to move on to the tightening
當然，有了夠多想法之後，
緊要階段就要挑出可行的想法

151
00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.470
stage and see whether this idea actually holds.
當然，有了夠多想法之後，
緊要階段就要挑出可行的想法

152
00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:27.610
But that's a different function.
緊要階段的思考模式不同之前

153
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:29.210
It comes later in the scientific cycle.
科學流程的工作模式都是由鬆入緊

154
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.470
Now in this lecture, we've talked about generating theoretical ideas.
這一講談了如何建構理論的建議

155
00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:39.310
Throughout the course, we mainly focus on drawing valid statistical inferences.
之前的每一講主要討論有效的統計推論

156
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:43.470
But you cannot draw good statistical inferences without having a good theory.
但是沒有好的理論就沒有好的統計推論

157
00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.170
So theory construction and generating valid theoretical predictions
建構理論與有效的預測

158
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.630
is just as important as statistical inferences,
和統計推論是同樣重要的

159
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.140
although it might be more difficult to teach.
雖然理論的建構很難教授

160
00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.635
It's important to keep in mind that a good theory and
好的研究者要時時記住好理論

161
00:08:54.635 --> 00:08:57.537
good statistical inferences are two sides of the same coin.
與好的統計推論是一體兩面

162
00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:03.089
