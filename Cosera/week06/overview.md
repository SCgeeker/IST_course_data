Statistical inferences are strongly intertwined with philosophy of science (see the interview with Zoltan Dienes!). Although you could spend an entire course on Philosophy of Science (my favorite is a lecture series by Paul Meehl you can watch [HERE](http://meehl.umn.edu/recordings/philosophical-psychology-1989)), you should at least get a quick introduction (Lecture 6.1).



One question many people have asked themselves, is whether the null hypothesis is an interesting theory to test. In Lecture 6.2 you will be able to reflect upon this question (the answer is the same as always in Science: It depends). Simply rejecting the null-hypothesis is often not very exciting, and to spice things up a little, you will learn how to perform equivalence testing (which allows you to conclude the effect is probably small enough not to be worthwhile) in assignment 6.1.



As I mentioned in the introduction, the goal of doing experiments is not to calculate statistics, but to draw inferences about theories. Some people have remarked that it is weird we spend a lot of time on teaching you how to do statistics, but say nothing about theories. A short introduction to theory development is given in Lecture 6.3.



Can’t get enough? Some suggestions for additional reading:

Lecture 6.1

A great paper by Paul Meehl on philosophy of science, applied to psychology, is:

Meehl, P. E. (1990). Appraising and amending theories: The strategy of Lakatosian defense and two principles that warrant it. Psychological Inquiry, 1(2), 108–141.

Philosophy of science is a large topic, that often requires a book-length treatment. Some popular books are listed below:

Hull, D. L. (2010). Science as a process: an evolutionary account of the social and conceptual development of science. University of Chicago Press.

Ladyman, J. (2002). Understanding philosophy of science. London; New York: Routledge.

Godfrey-Smith, P. (2003). Theory and reality: an introduction to the philosophy of science. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.

Lecture 6.2

Abelson nicely explains why critics who say the null is always false are overstating their case:

Abelson, R. P. (1997). On the Surprising Longevity of Flogged Horses: Why There Is a Case for the Significance Test. Psychological Science, 8(1), 12–15. http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00536.x

Similarly, Hagen has written an article ‘In Praise of Null-Hypothesis Significance Testing’ where he explains some strengths of the procedure:

Hagen, R. (1997). In praise of the null hypothesis statistical test. The American Psychologist, 52(1), 15–24.

Finally, the article recommended previously by Nickerson discusses this topic in detail:

Nickerson, R. S. (2000). Null hypothesis significance testing: a review of an old and continuing controversy. Psychological methods, 5(2), 241-301.

A good review on equivalence testing (related to Assignment 6.1) can be found here:

Meyners, M. (2012). Equivalence tests – A review. Food Quality and Preference, 26(2), 231–245. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2012.05.003


Lecture 6.3

The book on Theory Construction I recommend in the lecture is:

Jaccard, J., & Jacoby, J. (2010). Theory Construction and Model-building Skills: A Practical Guide for Social Scientists. Guilford Press.

The article by McGuire I discuss is:

McGuire, W. J. (2004). A Perspectivist Approach to Theory Construction. Personality and Social Psychology Review, 8(2), 173–182. http://doi.org/10.1207/s15327957pspr0802_11

An excellent, must-read article on theory construction by Klaus Fiedler is:

Fiedler, K. (2004). Tools, toys, truisms, and theories: Some thoughts on the creative cycle of theory formation. Personality and Social Psychology Review, 8(2), 123–131.
