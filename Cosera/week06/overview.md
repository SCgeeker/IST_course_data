Statistical inferences are strongly intertwined with philosophy of science (see the interview with Zoltan Dienes!). Although you could spend an entire course on Philosophy of Science (my favorite is a lecture series by Paul Meehl you can watch HERE), you should at least get a quick introduction (Lecture 6.1).

統計推論與科學哲學息息相關（見 Zoltan Dienes的訪問！）。雖然你可以花整個課程去研讀科學哲學（我最喜歡的是Paul Meehl的講座系列，你可以在[這兒][1] 看到），由於課程緊湊，我會在講演6.1作一個快速的介紹。


One question many people have asked themselves, is whether the null hypothesis is an interesting theory to test. In Lecture 6.2 you will be able to reflect upon this question (the answer is the same as always in Science: It depends). Simply rejecting the null-hypothesis is often not very exciting, and to spice things up a little, you will learn how to perform equivalence testing (which allows you to conclude the effect is probably small enough not to be worthwhile) in assignment 6.1.

許多人會問自己，究竟虛無假設是否是一個值得測試有趣的理論。在講演6.2中，您將能夠反思這個問題（這個問題的答案在許多科學領域或多或少會見到）。單純拒絕虛無假設通常不太有趣。為了讓這個問題更有意思，在作業6.1中，你會學到如何執行等效測試（等效測試幫你判斷究竟效果是否太小而不值得去深究）。

As I mentioned in the introduction, the goal of doing experiments is not to calculate statistics, but to draw inferences about theories. Some people have remarked that it is weird we spend a lot of time on teaching you how to do statistics, but say nothing about theories. A short introduction to theory development is given in Lecture 6.3.

正如我在課程導言提到的，做實驗的目的不是分析數據，而是對理論作出推論。有些人說我們花很多時間教你統計學而對理論隻字不提，覺得十分奇怪。在講演6.3中，我們會介紹如何發展理論。

A great paper by Paul Meehl on philosophy of science, applied to psychology, is:
一篇應用於心理學，講解科學哲學的文章，由Paul Meehl 撰寫：

Meehl, P. E. (1990). Appraising and amending theories: The strategy of Lakatosian defense and two principles that warrant it. Psychological Inquiry, 1(2), 108–141.

Philosophy of science is a large topic, that often requires a book-length treatment. Some popular books are listed below:

科學哲學是一個很廣泛的課題，通常需要以書本的形式作詳盡的介紹。一些介紹科學哲學的普及書籍如下：

Lecture 6.2
講演6.2:


Abelson nicely explains why critics who say the null is always false are overstating their case:

Abelson解釋了批評者如何誇大虛無假設永遠都是假的的事例：

Abelson, R. P. (1997). On the Surprising Longevity of Flogged Horses: Why There Is a Case for the Significance Test. Psychological Science, 8(1), 12–15. http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.1997.tb00536.x

Similarly, Hagen has written an article ‘In Praise of Null-Hypothesis Significance Testing’ where he explains some strengths of the procedure:

同樣地，Hagen 也寫了一篇文章關於虛無假設檢定的優點， 文章的標題是“讚美虛假假設顯著性檢定”：

Hagen, R. (1997). In praise of the null hypothesis statistical test. The American Psychologist, 52(1), 15–24.

Finally, the article recommended previously by Nickerson discusses this topic in detail:
先前推薦，由Nickerson撰寫的文章也對這個課題作詳細討論：

Nickerson, R. S. (2000). Null hypothesis significance testing: a review of an old and continuing controversy. Psychological methods, 5(2), 241-301.

A good review on equivalence testing (related to Assignment 6.1) can be found here:

有關等效測試（與作業6.1相關）的回顧：
