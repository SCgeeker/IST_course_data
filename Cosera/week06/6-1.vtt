[科學哲學]

2
00:00:09.185 --> 00:00:11.440
In this lecture we'll talk
about Philosophy of Science.
這一講來談談「科學哲學」。

3
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.755
I'll give a brief overview of
the history of Philosophy of Science.
我將簡單介紹科學哲學的歷史。

4
00:00:15.755 --> 00:00:18.705
Now this is a topic that you
can spend an entire course on.
這個主題應該用好幾堂課來談

5
00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:21.285
If you are interested,
I highly recommend you do this.
如果你有興趣建議去選修相關課程

6
00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:23.145
But you should at least know the basics.
這一講只提一些基本課題

7
00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:25.865
Can we ever have something
that's objectively true?
像是我們能對事物做出客觀真實的論斷？

8
00:00:25.865 --> 00:00:28.345
Do we know whether something
is a science or not?
我們能判別科學與偽科學嗎？

9
00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:30.015
These are important questions to consider.
都是值得思考的問題。

10
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.920
Now if we ask ourselves the question,
what makes something scientific?
首先想想這個問題：什麼造就了科學？

11
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.890
Then we are asking,
what is the demarcation criteria?
接著可以問：科學有沒有清楚的界線？

12
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.326
What differentiates between science and
pseudoscience?
科學與偽科學有何差異？

13
00:00:42.326 --> 00:00:45.380
Do you think that astrology
is a scientific discipline?
你認為占星術是科學的一部分嗎？

14
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.576
Should we use tax money to
fund research on astrology?
人民的稅金可以用來補助占星術的研究嗎？

15
00:00:49.576 --> 00:00:53.345
Do you think that precognition, studying
whether we can predict the future or
可以補助探索人類有沒有預見未來能力的超感知覺研究嗎？

16
00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:56.040
not is a science and
should we fund it based on tax money?
可以補助探索人類有沒有預見未來能力的超感知覺研究嗎？

17
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.450
Do you think that my own discipline,
experimental psychology is a science and
或者我安身立命的實驗心理學才是真正的科學

18
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.190
should we fund this?
才值得補助？

19
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.801
You see that the question whether
something is a science or
這些問題點出了解一項研究是不是科學，

20
00:01:05.801 --> 00:01:07.874
not has real life consequences.
會對現實生活造成影響

21
00:01:07.874 --> 00:01:11.664
If we think about demarcation criteria,
then different people have different
然而劃分科學與偽科學的界線

22
00:01:11.664 --> 00:01:15.509
opinions about whether we can say that
there's a difference between science and
人人心中各有一把尺。

23
00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.370
pseudoscience.
人人心中各有一把尺

24
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.390
Popper says that if a theory is
falsifiable, then it's scientific and
波普(Popper)的劃分標準是理論能不能被否證

25
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.740
this is the demarcation
criteria according to Popper.
波普(Popper)的劃分標準是理論能不能被否證

26
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.670
But not everybody agrees.
不過並非人人同意他的看法

27
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.230
For example, Lakatos says that a given
fact is explained scientifically
像是他的學生拉卡托斯(Lakatos)認為除非理論能正確預測新事實，對舊事實的解釋才是科學的。

28
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.380
only if a new fact is predicted with it.
像是他的學生拉卡托斯(Lakatos)認為除非理論能正確預測新事實，對舊事實的解釋才是科學的。

29
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.550
You should not just describe things
that you see, but your new descriptions
科學研究不能只描述現在看到的事物
也要描述

30
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.920
are scientific explanations when
they can also predict new things.
能預測的事物，以及新的事實

31
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.266
When they can explain new information.
能預測的事物，以及新的事實

32
00:01:47.266 --> 00:01:50.743
There are also people who give up on
trying to differentiate between science
也有人主張沒有必要區分科學與偽科學

33
00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.398
and pseudoscience.
也有人主張沒有必要區分科學與偽科學

34
00:01:52.398 --> 00:01:56.380
Well known example is Paul Feyerabend,
he says that given any rule,
像是波普的另一位學生費耶阿本德(Feyerabend)認為

35
00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.450
there are always circumstances when it is
advisable not only to ignore the rule, but
總會出現反對現存規範的案例

36
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.320
to adopt its opposite.
總會出現反對現存規範的案例

37
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.990
So there's never rule that you can follow
that will differentiate between science
所以不存在能準確劃分科學與偽科學的標準

38
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.150
and pseudoscience, anything goes.
他的名言是”諸行皆可“(anything goes)。

39
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.190
If we draw in inferences from data,
then there are logical ways to do this and
根據資料做推論，有邏輯與非邏輯的方法

40
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.270
illogical ways to do this.
根據資料做推論，有邏輯與非邏輯的方法

41
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.720
In propositional logic, one valid rule of
inference is known as the Modus Tollens.
能做有效推論的一種邏輯方法是否定後件(Modus Tollens)

42
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.520
In other words, denying the consequents.
簡單說就是否定推論得到的結果

43
00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.110
Let's take a look.
簡單說就是否定推論得到的結果

44
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.000
If the Modus Tollens is used we have
a line of reasoning that goes as this.
否定後件能寫成這樣的形式

45
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.960
If p then q, not q, therefore not p.
若p則q，非q
所以非p

46
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.490
Let's make it a little bit more concrete.
來看看這條規則的實際用處

47
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.950
If we have a theory,
then we should observe some data.
根據要驗證的理論，我們收集需要的資料

48
00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.020
Then we collect some data but we do not
observe the data that we predicted.
但是收集到的資料不符合理論的預測

49
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:58.089
From this we can deny the consequent,
therefore not the theory.
根據否定後件的規則，推論理論不成立

50
00:02:58.089 --> 00:03:01.846
A very often illogical way of drawing
inferences is known as affirming
另一方面就是採取非邏輯方法
從肯定的角度進行推論

51
00:03:01.846 --> 00:03:03.100
the consequent.
另一方面就是採取非邏輯方法
從肯定的角度進行推論

52
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.180
Now this is not a valid rule of
inference although it's tempting to use.
雖然這種方法有時有用
卻非有效的推論規則

53
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.060
It goes like this,
if p then q we observe q therefore p.
寫成邏輯形式就是
若p則q，觀察到q，所以p成立。

54
00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.500
Now this might look like it's logical but
it isn't.
雖然這像是邏輯規則，其實不是

55
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:19.640
Let's look at some more detail.
讓我告訴你為什麼

56
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.810
If we have a theory then we
should observe some data,
為了確認手上理論為真，我們必須收集資料

57
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.360
we observe the data and then we conclude
that therefore the theory is true.
收集到的資料要用來確認理論為真

58
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.780
Now this might still look
like it's valid but it isn't.
這樣的命題推理似乎有效，其實不然

59
00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.060
Let's make it even more concrete.
讓我用更明確的例子

60
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.416
Let's say that I conclude that if
I'm a man then I'm also a human.
我說“若我是男人，那我也是人類”

61
00:03:41.416 --> 00:03:46.171
I observe that I am a human and then I
conclude that therefore I must be a man,
我觀察到我是人類，所以結論我是男人

62
00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:48.655
but this last step is not valid.
這樣的推論其實無效

63
00:03:48.655 --> 00:03:51.077
I could also be a woman or
anything in between.
因為我也可以是女人或跨性別者

64
00:03:53.683 --> 00:03:56.959
A theory can be either refuted or
corroborated but
一個理論可以被證明為錯，或有證據證成

65
00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.430
you can never prove a theory.
但不能直接推論為真

66
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.310
Now this is important.
這個認識很重要

67
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.350
We can never have certain knowledge.
我們不會有肯定的知識

68
00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.490
We can aim for it but
we can never achieve it.
這個目標可以努力但永遠無法達成

69
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.730
It's easier to refute a theory and this is
based on Popper's idea of falsification.
波普的否證論概念就是證明理論為錯較容易

70
00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.930
So you can have a conclusion
where you falsify a prediction.
只要否證一個預測就會有結論

71
00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.670
For example, if we look at the prediction,
all swans are white, now, no number
例如這一則預測：
所有天鵝都是白的，就算不知道白天鵝有多少隻

72
00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:28.240
of sightings of white swans can ever prove
the theory that all swans are white.
永遠可以宣稱這個預測為真

73
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.570
However, if we only see one black swan,
但是，只要今天看見一隻黑天鵝

74
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.250
this will disprove our theory
that all swans are white.
這個預測就會被推翻

75
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:38.960
So you see that falsification is
a very potent tool to reject theories.
由此可見否證論推翻理論的威力

76
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:44.070
Now we can never accept them, we can
observe observations that are in line with
反過來說，即使無法完全證明理論為真，

77
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.710
our theory but we can never prove it.
只要獲得的資料與預測一致，理論還是可能為真

78
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.330
However, when we use inferences
based on statistics,
然而在統計推論的場域

79
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.080
then falsifications are never really black
or white, as the case with black swans.
並不像黑天鵝問題一樣有非黑即白的否證

80
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.622
If you see a black swan and
you have a clear view,
看見黑天鵝是鐵錚錚的否證證據

81
00:04:58.622 --> 00:05:02.040
then you can be pretty sure
that this is not a white swan.
看見黑天鵝是鐵錚錚的否證證據

82
00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.090
You might even get a feather and try to
wash it, see that the black doesn't come
如果你很龜毛，可能會洗洗看
黑天鵝的羽毛會不會掉色

83
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.180
off and then you have a solid
observation that black swans exist.
再決定要不要接受這個證據

84
00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.750
In statistics we always
work with probabilities.
統計則是依賴機率

85
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.571
We have a certain probability that the
data we have observed, is surprising for
資料的否證程度全賴歸察到的機率

86
00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:17.510
example.
資料的否證程度全賴歸察到的機率

87
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:21.750
We have a certain probability
that there is no true effect.
只能斷言沒有真實效果的機率

88
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.540
Now this kind of statements
are never completely black or white.
這樣的結論永遠不會非黑即白

89
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.427
So it's always more difficult
to falsify a prediction.
所以任何統計的預測被否證的難度頗高

90
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.000
Furthermore, we wonder whether we
actually reject theories after
更進一步的說，理論很難被一種否證證據推翻

91
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.640
a single falsification.
更進一步的說，理論很難被一種否證證據推翻

92
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.270
And Lakatos argues that we never do this.
拉卡托斯指出不可能有這樣的否證

93
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.790
People have some sort of feeling for
a theory.
想出理論的方式有很多種

94
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.810
They like a specific theory and
they want it to be true.
有的理論的目標很特定

95
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:46.020
And this is perfectly fine.
只要不被特定的證據推翻就好

96
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.629
You can try to find support for
it in different ways.
支持理論的證據也是各式各樣

97
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.990
Now there are good reasons
to stick with the theory.
測試理論會不會被推翻其實很有意義

98
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:58.660
When a theory makes a very, very good
predictions then a single observation
如果能用理論做個好預測

99
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.680
that's not in line with your predictions
is no reason to give up the entire theory.
然後獲得不支持理論預測的證據
就可以毫無懸念的放棄理論。

100
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.430
This statement by Stevens is rather nice.
Stevens的這段話說得很好

101
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.880
It says, the lesson of history is that
a bold and plausible theory that fills
科學史上有許多大膽又合理的理論

102
00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.050
a scientific need is seldom broken by the
impact of contrary facts and arguments.
被反證的事實與言論擊倒

103
00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.650
Only with an alternative theory can
we hope to displace a defective one.
而且總是有新的理論取代舊理論的位置

104
00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.790
So it's perfectly fine if you
sometimes observe a finding
如果你能發現和你的理論預測不同的證據其實是好事

105
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:27.890
that's not in line with
theoretical predictions.
如果你能發現和你的理論預測不同的證據其實是好事

106
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:30.040
You don't have to throw your
theory out of the window.
你不必直接捨棄理論。

107
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.960
If you have a strong theory that makes
good predictions in other fields,
如果原來理論的預測在其他地方經得起考驗

108
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.280
there's no reason to give it up
until you have a better theory.
依然可以堅持到有更好的理論出現

109
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.230
So if there's a falsification,
如果理論的預測被否證

110
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:47.210
if one of these predictions don't hold
up then what is exactly falsified?
代表理論本身被否證嗎？

111
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.960
Is it the theory itself or
there are auxiliary theories.
被否證的是理論本體還是附屬命題？

112
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.490
Assumptions that you make about the data
collection process, for example.
設想你做了一次資料收集

113
00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:57.820
Now let's say you do
an experiment on some people and
像是根據一個理論預測，找些人做了實驗

114
00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.340
you have a theoretical prediction.
像是根據一個理論預測，找些人做了實驗

115
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.320
And it's not supported by the data.
不過結果不符合預測

116
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.310
Now you can either distrust your
theory itself or you can say,
此時可以捨棄這套理論

117
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:11.310
well maybe something else that I assumed
was going on didn't happen as I predicted.
也可以認為實驗過程沒有做好

118
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.690
For example, maybe your
participants were very, very tired.
像是找到的參與者精神狀態都很差

119
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.900
They didn't process all
the information you provided.
無法處理好實驗過程中的訊息

120
00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:21.870
And as a consequence, you didn't
observe the effect that you predicted.
以致於結果不如預期

121
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.210
Now in these situations,
you might not throw away your theory.
若是如此
還不必拋棄理論

122
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:25.750
You might say,
你可以說

123
00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:29.650
well some of the assumption that I made
about how much attention participants were
是因為實驗操作不符合理論中注意力集中的前提

124
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.250
paying to the experiments,
those assumptions are violated.
需要再試一次

125
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.200
Let's try it again, let's try to boost
the attention levels of participants and
看看注意力集中的參與者表現

126
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.610
see if we can find the expected effect.
會不會符合預測

127
00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.300
According to Lakatos, we have a core
theory and around this core theory there's
拉卡托斯主張理論有不可更改的硬核

128
00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.410
protective belt of auxiliary hypotheses,
these are assumptions that you make about
以及可調整假設命題的保護帶

129
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.559
the research process and you can give up
some of these assumptions or change them.
研究者可以在過程中修改或放棄保護帶的某些命題

130
00:07:56.570 --> 00:08:00.080
In this sense, you can keep your
core theory, even if your prediction
這樣的主張指出，
若是為了做出更好的預測

131
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.180
doesn't pan out by changing some
of the assumptions that you make.
而調整部分假設，還是能保留硬核

132
00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:05.870
Now, of course, when you do this,
但是如此一來

133
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:09.830
you enter what's known as
a degenerative research line.
就會進入「退化性研究進程」

134
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:14.700
It's fine to make an ad hoc assumption
saying, well, it's true but only if.
有時為了提高預測力而提出增加可能條件的後設假設

135
00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.380
But if you have to keep doing this and
keep doing this,
但長久為之，理論將不再能提出新的預測

136
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.220
then your theory is not
making new predictions.
但長久為之，理論將不再能提出新的預測

137
00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.030
There are no new facts that are predicted
with the theory that you make.
因為這樣的理論無法預測並解釋新的事實

138
00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.850
You're just trying to change the theory
只能持續存活到失敗的預測無法修補為止

139
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:29.860
every time when a failed
prediction emerges.
只能持續存活到失敗的預測無法修補為止

140
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.050
What you ideally want is to turn this
into a progressive research line.
有生命的理論應是處於「進化性研究進程」

141
00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.148
A first failed test is perfectly fine.
第一次測試失敗不打緊

142
00:08:37.148 --> 00:08:41.410
You can slightly change your theory or
one of the assumptions you're making, but
只改變少數假設

143
00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:43.980
then this should lead to
a progressive research line,
就能推進到進化性研究進程是最好的

144
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.515
there should be new facts that you can
predict with your improved theory.
如此的理論能持續預測新事實

145
00:08:48.515 --> 00:08:51.845
When this is not the case,
it's perfectly fine to keep trying but
就算持續修正還是無法預測新事實的理論

146
00:08:51.845 --> 00:08:56.775
after a while, you enter a research
line that's not giving anything new,
就算持續修正還是無法預測新事實的理論

147
00:08:56.775 --> 00:08:59.405
which happened with astrology in the past.
曾在天文學歷史出現過

148
00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:02.900
So according to Lakatos, something like
astrology would not be a scientific
拉卡托斯認為無法保持進化性研究進程的天文學理論

149
00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:06.505
discipline because it never turned
into a progressive research line.
不能算是科學理論

150
00:09:06.505 --> 00:09:11.215
They're only ad hoc changes to the theory
every time when a failed prediction
只是一堆失敗預測堆成的補丁式理論。

151
00:09:11.215 --> 00:09:11.870
emerges.
只是一堆失敗預測堆成的補丁式理論。

152
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.010
Now there are some people
who doubt whether we can
很多唸過科學哲學的人會問有沒有客觀科學存在？

153
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:20.380
have an objective science altogether.
很多唸過科學哲學的人會問有沒有客觀科學存在？

154
00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.380
So they say the quest for
an objective truth is a nice try, but
有人主張這尋找客觀事實是高尚的目標

155
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.200
we'll never really reach it.
但是沒有達成的一日

156
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.640
One of them is Thomas Kuhn in his book
The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.
湯馬斯孔恩是其中一人
他的名著“科學革命的結構”

157
00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:34.870
He says that observations are always
theory laden, not objective.
就提到任何觀察都帶有理論的觀點，並非客觀

158
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.840
There's no such thing as
an objective view at the world.
世上沒有絕對客觀的立場

159
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.790
We always look at the world
with certain assumptions and
我們總是帶著某個理論色彩的眼鏡看這個世界
科學研究也不例外

160
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:43.370
these assumptions color the way
that we do our research.
我們總是帶著某個理論色彩的眼鏡看這個世界
科學研究也不例外

161
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.120
He goes as far as to say,
孔恩又提到

162
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:51.390
that the proponents of competing paradigms
practice their trades in different worlds.
相互對抗的典範支持者在各自的世界中交流

163
00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.050
What he means is that it's possible for
也就是說

164
00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:56.530
researchers to have different
theoretical backgrounds and
理論背景各異的研究者

165
00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:59.724
they will look at the world in completely
different ways that you cannot unify.
只關注與自己有關的資訊
不會互相往來

166
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:05.460
He talks about how people
practice puzzle-solving science,
他以應該是科學進展主力的基礎科學為例

167
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.820
which is basically normal science
as science should progress.
說明科學家如何解決難題

168
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:14.290
And this is followed by a paradigm shift,
a revolution in science, and after
隨著典範轉移，開始發生科學革命

169
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:18.930
such a scientific revolution, we look at
the world in a completely different way.
在革命之後，世人觀看世界的眼光徹底改變

170
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.160
And after a scientific revolution we
cannot interpret the data that we
像是革命之後推論資料的方式

171
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.630
collected before this paradigm shift.
與典範轉移之前完全不同

172
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.440
Things completely change.
世界會改變

173
00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.720
So there's no objective knowledge.
所以沒有客觀的知識

174
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.670
Things always depend on the specific
paradigm that you're in.
何為真實全看你所憑依的典範

175
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.770
According to Kuhn,
science is not cumulative, but
孔恩認為科學進展不是累積的

176
00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.590
it's revolutionary,
based on subjective reasons.
而是基於主觀理由發動的革命

177
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:44.060
These can be social norms or
idyllic ideas that people have.
就像是大眾遵守的社會規範或共同理念也會改變

178
00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.600
So it's not that science will always just
progress and become better and better,
科學進展的方向不一定是越來越好

179
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.730
the idea that Lakatos is expressing
in his progressive research lines,
但不像拉卡托斯的研究進程說法

180
00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:55.040
no instead, there's just
a revolution every now and then.
孔恩認為是週而復始的革命造成

181
00:10:55.040 --> 00:11:02.070
And we have a completely different
paradigm within which we practice science.
才會產生前後不一樣的科學操作典範

182
00:11:02.070 --> 00:11:06.474
Modern few points on philosophy of science
acknowledge that scientific knowledge is
現代科學哲學的論點讓我們了解
科學知識也是一種社會產物

183
00:11:06.474 --> 00:11:08.130
a social product.
現代科學哲學的論點讓我們了解
科學知識也是一種社會產物

184
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:14.880
For example, Helen Longino talks about how
we have no objective knowledge, but there
像Helen Longino認為就算沒有客觀知識

185
00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:20.640
is only intersubjective criticism, what
constitutes the objectivity of science.
互為主體的批判也能構成科學的客觀性

186
00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.250
So there's no objectivity outside of
the social enterprise that science is.
但這種客觀性不能自外於科學所存在的社會體系

187
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.580
What's important, according to Longino,
is public avenues for
Longino還強調批判的公眾性

188
00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:34.730
criticism, for example peer review, when
you submit your paper for publication.
像是投稿期刊的同儕評審

189
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:39.160
What's important is that there is room for
peers to criticize your finding or
讓同行專家有空間批判或改善彼此的作品

190
00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.330
improve it if possible.
讓同行專家有空間批判或改善彼此的作品

191
00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:45.220
There should be shared standards, we
should have some idea of what we're doing.
還有共同遵守的標準
科學家有行事的一致信念

192
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.750
A tool set that we use
to evaluate evidence.
還有可共同評估證據的方法

193
00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:51.170
There should be open reevaluation.
此外還應該有公開的自省機制

194
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:53.640
So if there's criticism and
there are new insights,
一旦批評帶來新的洞見

195
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:56.000
a scientific discipline should change.
科學社群應該改變

196
00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.650
Again, this is not something
that happens in astrology.
就像過去天文學的改變並非一天之內發生

197
00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:01.300
There's enough criticism on astrology but
而是經歷幾十年批判的累積

198
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.150
it never really changed
in the last decades.
而是經歷幾十年批判的累積

199
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.490
And finally, what's important for
最後

200
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:11.220
this social intersubjective objectivity
is that there's equality within peers.
互為主體的社會化客觀性強調同儕之間的平等

201
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.400
If you have an informed
researcher that knows what he or
如果研究是共同合作

202
00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.660
she is doing, then these people should
have equality in their interaction.
成員之間的互動應該是平等的

203
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:21.280
It should not be the case that
one person can determine,
不該有一個人決定研究如何進行

204
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.390
this is how it's going to be because
I'm the most powerful individual here.
只因為其中的一位成員有較大的權勢

205
00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:28.740
In this lecture we briefly talked
about philosophy of science and
這一講簡單介紹科學哲學

206
00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:33.290
different perspectives that philosophers
have on what makes something scientific.
和不同哲學家認為科學是什麼的觀點

207
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:35.650
Personally I think,
the idea of a progressive and
我自己從進化及退化的科學進程受益良多

208
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.150
a degenerative research
line is quite useful.
我自己從進化及退化的科學進程受益良多

209
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:41.410
When you make a prediction that
doesn't pan out, you're in trouble,
若是結果不符合預測，得費更多力氣

210
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:45.320
you have to try to turn this into
a progressive research line in the future.
將這門研究推向進化性研究進程

211
00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:46.245
But overall,
總而言之

212
00:12:46.245 --> 00:12:51.574
there's no clear single answer on whether
we can ever have objective knowledge.
世上有沒有客觀知識並沒有清楚的答案

213
00:12:51.574 --> 00:12:55.589
