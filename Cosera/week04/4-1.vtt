效果量

2
00:00:09.861 --> 00:00:13.430
In this lecture we'll talk about the concept of effect sizes.
這一講是效果量的概念入門

3
00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.030
I'll explain what they're good for, how you can use them, and
我會說明善用效果量的好處，使用的方式

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.740
why you should report them.
還有應該報告效果量的理由

5
00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.820
And in the next lectures, we'll dive into more detail in two families of effect
後續兩講介紹兩大類效果量

6
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.480
sizes, Cohen's d and correlations.
Cohen's d與相關係數

7
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.570
Now there are some people who think that effect sizes are in
在報告中呈現效果量已經是許多研究者的共識

8
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.610
essence the main thing that we're interested in when we perform a study.
在報告中呈現效果量已經是許多研究者的共識

9
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.900
There might be a lot of attention to the specific level of the p value, but
過去論文的寫作與閱讀特別注意p值的呈現

10
00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.630
Cohen was one of the first to point out the importance of
而Cohen為代表的學者首先指出

11
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.970
effect sizes in the scientific literature, and he says this is basically the main
在科學文獻裡呈現效果量的重要性

12
00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.560
thing that you want to know, the primary product of a researching crew.
更指出這應該是呈現研究成果的基本形式

13
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.960
So it's important to always report these effect sizes, but not just to report them,
報告效果量不只是論文寫作的必知事項

14
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.720
but also to correctly interpret them.
也要了解正確的解讀方式

15
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.150
Effect sizes serve three main goals.
呈現效果量有三大目標

16
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.010
First of all,
首先

17
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.240
they allow you to communicate the practical significance of the results.
作者可借此傳達研究操作的結果真正顯著之處

18
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.460
And effect might be statistically significant, but
儘管效果是統計顯著的

19
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.820
does it actually really matter in practice?
但真的是研究操作造成的嗎？

20
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.950
Second, effect sizes allow you to draw meta-analytic conclusions.
其二、效果量有助整合分析式結論的佈局

21
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.560
If there are a number of studies in the published literature, you can group all
只要收集同主題的出版文獻，
任何人都能整合並計算整合分析效果量

22
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.910
these studies together, calculate the meta-analytic effect size and
只要收集同主題的出版文獻，
任何人都能整合並計算整合分析效果量

23
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.380
get the best estimate of the true effect size in the population.
可估計來源母群的真實效果量

24
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.170
If we take a look at simulated studies where we perform independent t-tests and
拿這個獨立t檢定模擬研究來說

25
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.720
each group has 25 participants,
每一群有25人

26
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.640
you can see that there's quite a lot of variation in the effect size estimate.
這幅森林圖(forest plot)裡每個方塊代表一項研究結果

27
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.220
This forest plot illustrates effect sizes by the squares.
每個結果的平均值變異範圍很大


28
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.630
And you can see that the squares jump around a little bit on the xs and
最下面的菱形代表這些研究的整合效果量

29
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.340
the xs is the effect size.
最下面的菱形代表這些研究的整合效果量

30
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.370
So in this case there's actually no true effect size,
因為菱形落在數值0之上

31
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.210
there's no true effect in the population, so the true effect size is zero.
表示並沒有真實效果存在，所以效果量為0

32
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.050
But we've drawn random samples from this population and
圖中的所有研究是取自母群的隨機樣本

33
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.310
you can see that the effect size estimate within each individual sample actually
研究結果平均值有高有低

34
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.690
differs from quite reasonably high and quite reasonably low effect size estimate,
但是都與0相差不遠

35
00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.530
even though the true estimate should be zero.
所以估計的效果量為0是合理的

36
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.323
Now finally effect sizes allow
you to perform a power analysis.
最後，效果量是檢定力分析的素材

37
00:02:21.323 --> 00:02:23.967
When we talk about controlling type two errors,
上週談型二錯誤率控制的課程裡

38
00:02:23.967 --> 00:02:28.298
it's important to think about what the true effect might be in the population.
提到了解真實效果的重要性

39
00:02:28.298 --> 00:02:32.975
And an effect size tells you this, and you can use it in a power analysis to
有了效果量估計值，你可以用檢定力分析

40
00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:37.809
determine the amount participants that the study would require to achieve
決定能成功發現真實效果的所需樣本數

41
00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:42.356
a certain probability of finding a true effect if it's really there.
決定能成功發現真實效果的所需樣本數

42
00:02:42.356 --> 00:02:46.228
Now this is an example of G power, which is free software, and
這是G Power軟體的介面截圖

43
00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:49.592
I'm not going to explain exactly how you should use it.
這段影片我不會詳述使用方法

44
00:02:49.592 --> 00:02:51.415
We'll talk about this in an assignment.
本週作業有詳細的指引

45
00:02:51.415 --> 00:02:56.066
I just want to highlight this field where you see that the effect size, Cohen's d,
只要注意這張圖的Effect size dz欄位

46
00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:59.867
needs to be inserted if you want to perform the power calculations.
輸入數值就可以計算檢定力

47
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:06.434
There are different types of effect sizes.
效果量有許多種類

48
00:03:06.434 --> 00:03:08.826
There are unstandardized effect sizes,
像是非標準化效果量

49
00:03:08.826 --> 00:03:13.412
which are basically the difference that
you've observed between two groups.
就只是兩組之間的差異

50
00:03:13.412 --> 00:03:16.775
Let's say you measure how quickly I can run down the corridor.
像是用碼錶測量人類的主觀計時

51
00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:19.343
You measure how quickly someone else runs down the corridor.
就是到了指定秒數時，一個人能多快按錶

52
00:03:19.343 --> 00:03:25.300
You do this multiple times and you want to see whether one or the other is fastest.
找兩個人做這個測試好幾次再來比較誰快

53
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.910
Now in this case, there's no need to calculate any weird type of effect size.
這個狀況不必計算任何奇怪的效果量

54
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.100
You can just use the time as an unstandardized effect size.
兩個人的時間差就是非標準化效果量

55
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.180
People all understand how to interpret time.
結果人人都看得懂

56
00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.360
So time is a very logical skill to use, and
時間單位是有邏輯的單位

57
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.130
if I'm two seconds faster, you know how you should interpret this.
我說其中一人快了兩秒，你馬上就懂什麼意思

58
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.370
Now not all research allows you to used on standardized effect sizes.
可惜不是所有研究都適合用非標準化效果量

59
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.700
For example think about people in the literature who study happiness.
例如快樂感研究用的量表

60
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.400
They might measure happiness by asking people how happy are you at this moment.
有測量當下的快樂感的七點量表

61
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.020
Ranging from not happy at all at 1, to 7, very happy.
選項有1代表不快樂，到代表7快樂

62
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.180
Other people in the literature might use a five point scale to measure happiness.
也有研究者用五點量表測量快樂感

63
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.740
We can immediately see that the happiness score of 4 does not have any
所以4在這兩份量表示的意義並不相同

64
00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.660
fixed meaning.
所以4在這兩份量表示的意義並不相同

65
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.560
It really depends on the scale that was used.
解讀時要注意是那一版量表

66
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.830
So if you want to compare the size of the difference between these studies,
如果要比較不同研究的效果量差異

67
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.840
we need to find a way to standardized these differences.
就要把差異標準化

68
00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.143
And that's what standardized effect size can do.
這就是需要標準化效果量的狀況

69
00:04:25.712 --> 00:04:29.750
Now it's very important to interpret the effect size of a study.
現在談如何正確解讀效果量

70
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.200
A statistically significant effect alone might not be real reason to worry.
統計顯著與否並不是關鍵

71
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.190
And this is a good example.
我用這個例子說明

72
00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.720
There was a study performed by Facebook which influenced how happy
這個研究展示什麼因素影響臉書使用者的快樂感受

73
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.800
people would feel.
這個研究展示什麼因素影響臉書使用者的快樂感受

74
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.360
The way that they did this was either by removing some very positive posts on
研究者的方法是移除使用者臉書頁面的
正面訊息或負面訊息

75
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:51.040
people's timelines or they removed very negative posts on people's timelines.
研究者的方法是移除使用者臉書頁面的
正面訊息或負面訊息

76
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.850
And then they measured the comments that people typed on Facebook and
然後測量使用者之後一段時間在臉書的留言正負面傾向

77
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.650
how positive or negative were the Facebook posts that people made.
然後測量使用者之後一段時間在臉書的留言正負面傾向

78
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.090
Now it's quite a lot of attention for this study because the result show that when
這研究的吸睛之處是結果顯示

79
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.050
people saw less positive information, people actually were slightly
使用者看到較少的正面訊息

80
00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.939
less positive in the Facebook messages that they post themselves.
個人留言也比較少正面訊息

81
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:17.370
Now if we look really at the data themselves and
不管報告的統計顯著，深入看資料細節的話

82
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.530
especially not on whether they were statistically significant or not, but
不管報告的統計顯著，深入看資料細節的話

83
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:27.683
at the effect size, we can see that the effect size here was a Cohen's d of 0.001.
這個研究結果的Cohen's d只有0.001 

84
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.300
Now that's a very tiny effect size.
是個非常微弱的效果量

85
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.840
It was statistically significant because Facebook has a huge amount of data.
結果是統計顯著是因為臉書有海量使用者

86
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.870
They have millions and millions of Facebook posts to analyze.
研究者分析的資料有「成億上兆」的臉書留言

87
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.570
But the difference that they observed was so small, that it was for
但是以實際效益來說，這樣的效果量並無任何意義

88
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:47.209
all practical purposes, almost meaningless.
但是以實際效益來說，這樣的效果量並無任何意義

89
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.000
This implies that the effect that they observed was so
這份報告呈現的資料集中於極少數的情緒性字詞的觀察

90
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.590
small in the emotional connotation of the words that
這份報告呈現的資料集中於極少數的情緒性字詞的觀察

91
00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:05.070
people typed that after 3,570 words, one more negative
像是使用者留言三千多個中性字詞後

92
00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.000
word was typed in the condition where people did not see the positive feedback.
寫出一個負向字詞就歸類為「負面回應」

93
00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.270
Now unless you type really,
除非使用者都在臉書寫很長的留言，
這樣的觀察很難反應個人行為

94
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:16.840
really long Facebook posts, this is not a noticeable effect at an individual level.
除非使用者都在臉書寫很長的留言，
這樣的觀察很難反映個別行為

95
00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.000
This is only statistically significant over a huge number of people.
這種差異只有放在巨量資料才會呈現統計顯著

96
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.440
But people already worried, and there was even one
但這樣的研究結果會讓人聯想到

97
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.850
blog post somewhere where they said we know that mood is correlated with suicide.
只要有一個部落客散播有關自殺的訊息，
會不會就有影響

98
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.120
So maybe by experimenting on people,
若是利用臉書進行這種社會實驗

99
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:33.710
Facebook actually caused more people to commit suicide.
搞不好會引起自殺朝

100
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.250
But if you interpret the effect size, you can see that the effect is so, so
不過理解效果量的意義之後

101
00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.249
tiny, that this is basically impossible to have real life consequences.
你會發現這對真實生活的影響非常微小

102
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.990
So it's important to think that effects might be statistically significant, but
研究發現的效果雖然有統計意義的顯著

103
00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.350
they can be practically insignificant.
卻沒有現實意義的顯著

104
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:54.860
Just because there is a true effect doesn't mean that we need to care or
即使效果確實存在也不代表值得擔心

105
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:55.650
worry about it.
即使效果確實存在也不代表值得擔心

106
00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.350
On the other hand, it's also important to realize
另一方面，理解能影響真實世界的微弱效果是很重要的

107
00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.710
that small effects might have real world consequences.
另一方面，理解能影響真實世界的微弱效果是很重要的

108
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.093
In the meta-analysis in which researchers studied interventions for
像是有關青少年犯罪處置研究的整合性分析

109
00:07:09.093 --> 00:07:13.915
juvenile delinquency, they found that these interventions had reliable but
顯示各類處置有些微但可信的效用

110
00:07:13.915 --> 00:07:16.776
small effects size, Cohen's d of 0.11.
換算成Cohen's d是0.11

111
00:07:16.776 --> 00:07:19.759
Now even though we consider this a small effect,
即使這些處置的效果微小

112
00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:25.016
it has real life consequences that changes people's lives after the intervention.
依然能真正改變一些人的人生

113
00:07:25.016 --> 00:07:29.765
Instead of 50% of the young people leaving jails going on to
因為這些處置讓青少年犯入監服刑的比例

114
00:07:29.765 --> 00:07:33.798
commit more crimes, this reduces to about 45%.
從50%降到45%

115
00:07:33.798 --> 00:07:38.052
So this might be a small difference, but it's a very impactful difference for
雖然整體數據改變不大，
卻帶給不少人不可估量的改變

116
00:07:38.052 --> 00:07:38.898
these people.
雖然整體數據改變不大，
卻帶給不少人不可估量的改變

117
00:07:41.875 --> 00:07:45.123
It's also important to interpret effect sizes because they can be
還需要知道的是效果量有可能是無法解釋的巨大

118
00:07:45.123 --> 00:07:46.410
implausibly large.
還需要知道的是效果量有可能是無法解釋的巨大

119
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.900
We talked about small effect sizes maybe being not really practically relevant.
剛剛提到微小的效果量也許沒有實質意義

120
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.360
But big effects can also make you wonder what's really being studied and
巨大的效果量也會讓研究者懷疑原始問題

121
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.250
whether the result really makes sense.
以及結果是不是真有意義

122
00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.300
Let's look at one example.
來看看這個例子

123
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.620
In this study, researchers found a correlation
這個研究報告白人的自殺率

124
00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:08.710
between the suicide rate of white individuals and
這個研究報告白人的自殺率

125
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:11.950
the amount of country music that was played on the radio.
與電台播放鄉村音樂的相關性

126
00:08:13.130 --> 00:08:17.840
Now this study won an award, an Ig Nobel prize, which is a prize for
作者因此獲得搞笑諾貝爾獎

127
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.860
studies that make you laugh and then make you think.
這個獎表揚讓人會心一笑又值得省思的研究

128
00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:26.280
Now, in this case I think this study should make you think effect sizes,
我認為這個研究提醒研究者發現巨大的效果量時

129
00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.370
and how implausibly large effect sizes might
要確定這項發現的可信度，而非僥倖

130
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:32.069
indicate that this is not a reliable effect, but just a fluke.
要確定這項發現的可信度，而非僥倖

131
00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:37.791
Indeed it turns out that follow up research was not able to confirm this
這種發現可能導致其他研究者難以重現

132
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:38.393
result.
這種發現可能導致其他研究者難以重現

133
00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:41.306
And if you look at the effect size in this case,
這份報告的的效果量是相關係數

134
00:08:41.306 --> 00:08:46.414
we can see that there's a correlation of .54, which is a large correlation.
作者報告.54，表示變項之間有相當高的相關

135
00:08:46.414 --> 00:08:49.030
That's a sizeable, noticeable effect.
高到很容易讓人聯想

136
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:53.693
And it should make you wonder whether it's likely that listening to country music on
會好奇聽鄉村音樂真的會提高自殺率

137
00:08:53.693 --> 00:08:58.093
the radio really has such a huge effect on the likelihood that people will commit
會好奇聽鄉村音樂真的會提高自殺率

138
00:08:58.093 --> 00:08:59.630
suicide.
會好奇聽鄉村音樂真的會提高自殺率

139
00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.810
If you see an effect size this large you should say,
有概念的研究者會提醒自已

140
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.310
I don't think that it's very plausible.
變項間很難有實質關係

141
00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:09.698
And you should make sure that you keep some doubts about the reliability of this
無論如何都要保持對這種發現的批判立場

142
00:09:09.698 --> 00:09:10.306
finding.
無論如何都要保持對這種發現的批判立場

143
00:09:13.023 --> 00:09:15.820
There are two types of families of effect sizes.
效果量主要有兩大類

144
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.300
A differentiation is made between the Cohen's d family,
Cohen's d一類的效果量主要用來測量差異

145
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.400
which are standardized mean differences.
大多數是標準化平均值差異

146
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.350
And the other hand we have the r family,
另一類是相關係數

147
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:29.150
which are measures of strength of association, things like correlations.
用來測量變項之間的關聯強度

148
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:34.230
And then the next lectures, we'll go into more detail about both these families.
之後兩講會深入介紹這兩類效果量

149
00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.080
Now in this lecture, we talked about the importance of reporting and
這一講談報告效果量的重要性

150
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.932
interpreting effect sizes.
還要解讀的必知要事

151
00:09:38.932 --> 00:09:44.180
Effect sizes might arguably be the most important outcome of a study.
有人認為效果量是研究報告最重要的成份

152
00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:47.990
The p value will tell you something about whether there's a signal or a noise.
p值指示研究能否真的偵測出效果

153
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.840
But even if there is noise, you might want to just accurately estimate that the true
即使偵測不到
還是可以用效果量估計真實為0的效果

154
00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:53.610
effect is almost completely zero.
即使偵測不到
還是可以用效果量估計真實為0的效果

155
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:59.037
So you should always report effect
sizes in your results sections, and
任何研究者應在報告中呈現效果量

156
00:09:59.037 --> 00:10:03.401
more importantly, you should also always
interpret the size of the effect.
更要仔細說明效果量的意義

157
00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:08.079
