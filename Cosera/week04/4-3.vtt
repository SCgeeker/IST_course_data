效果量：相關係數

2
00:00:08.743 --> 00:00:12.418
In this lecture, we'll continue talking about the effect sizes, but
這一講繼續談效果量

3
00:00:12.418 --> 00:00:15.870
now we'll focus on the R family of effect size measures.
主角是相關係數一類的效果量

4
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.070
These include correlations, but also effect size measures for
除了相關係數，還有變異數分析的效果量
像是eta平方

5
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.000
ANOVA such as eta squared.
除了相關係數，還有變異數分析的效果量
像是eta平方

6
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.500
Now, if we look into the scientific literature,
我們從科學文獻裡找到這個例子來做介紹

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.370
there's an example of an effect that can be describe by a correlation.
我們從科學文獻裡找到這個例子來做介紹

8
00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.970
Namely, the Chocolate Consumption in a country is related
這篇論文談論一國的巧克力消費量與獲得諾貝爾獎的關係

9
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.840
to the amount of Nobel Prizes that are won.
這篇論文談論一國的巧克力消費量與獲得諾貝爾獎的關係

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.230
Lets take a look at the data,
看看論文裡的資料

11
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.960
we can plot the amount of the Nobel Prize laureates on one axis.
這張圖的縱軸是諾貝爾獎得主人數

12
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.965
The amount of chocolate that's eaten in a country in the other axis and
橫軸是國內巧克力消費量

13
00:00:44.965 --> 00:00:47.240
there we see a strong positive correlation.
兩者有很強的正相關(0.79)

14
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.870
In this case,
首先聲明

15
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.470
I don't want to discuss how correlation does not imply causation, that's obvious.
我不想用這麼明顯的例子重申相關不等於因果

16
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.670
But here I just want to point at the size of the effect.
只是藉此說明效果量大小的解讀關鍵

17
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.500
As I mentioned before, it's very important to always interpret effect size and
如上一講所提，達0.8的效果量算是很高

18
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.330
in this case a correlation of 0.8 is huge.
必須小心地推測其中意義

19
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.360
Such a big effect that that alone should make you wonder whether this is real
特別是這樣的案例讓人不得不懷疑資料的真偽

20
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.950
data or not.
特別是這樣的案例讓人不得不懷疑資料的真偽

21
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.200
Now if you look at correlations, we can again specify benchmarks for
相關係數類的效果量也有一套小中大判斷標準

22
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.775
small, medium and large effect sizes.
相關係數類的效果量也有一套小中大判斷標準

23
00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:23.065
A small correlation of
0.1 as visualized here,
最小的效果量0.1，資料散佈如這張圖顯示

24
00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:27.265
again we're using the visualizations
from R Psychologist, great website.
和上一講相同，都是取自R Psycholgist網站

25
00:01:27.265 --> 00:01:32.105
Where you can play around with different visualizations for all sorts of basic
你可以用網站的視覺化工具了解

26
00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:36.040
statistical concept such as
correlations and other effect sizes.
相關與各類效果量的統計概念

27
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.663
So this is what the correlation of 0.1 looks like.
相關係數0.1的資料分佈大致像這樣

28
00:01:38.663 --> 00:01:40.810
A correlation that's medium.
這是相關係數的中效果量

29
00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.790
A medium effect size is a correlation of 0.3, visualized here as well.
相關係數至少是0.3才算中效果量，
如這張圖的分佈

30
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.094
In a large correlation, a benchmark is set to 0.5.
相關係數至少是0.5才算大效果量

31
00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:54.277
Now correlations range from zero, no effect,
相關係數的數值範圍包括0

32
00:01:54.277 --> 00:01:57.540
there's no relation between two variables.
代表變項之間沒有關係或無效果

33
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.330
To either minus one,
也包括-1

34
00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.620
a perfect negative correlation,
to plus one, perfect positive correlation.
代表絕對負相關
或是+1，代表絕對正相關

35
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.330
If you want to get a feel for
想要增加自已對相關性的感受
視覺化是不錯的方法

36
00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.260
what's correlations look like if you visualize them.
想要增加自已對相關性的感受
視覺化是不錯的方法

37
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:14.622
I can really recommend this website guessthecorrelation.com where they have
我真摰推薦這個網站guessthecorrelation.com

38
00:02:14.622 --> 00:02:17.480
game of fights recognizing effect size measures.
透過玩遊戲了解相關係數的效果量

39
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.960
And if you play around with this website,
玩過幾輪之後

40
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.279
you'll get a better understanding of what different effect sizes look like.
你會更了解相關係數數值與效果量大小

41
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.710
Now previously we talked about the Cohen's D measure of effect size.
前一講談使用Cohen's d測量效果量

42
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:34.290
Both Cohen's D and correlations can be used to calculate meta analysis.
而相關係數和Cohen's d一樣都可以做整合分析

43
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.290
Therefore, it might not be very surprising that you can calculate the Cohen's D
所以不必驚訝Cohen's d可以轉換成Cohen's r

44
00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.490
into a Cohen's R.
所以不必驚訝Cohen's d可以轉換成Cohen's r

45
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:42.140
You can convert the one into the other,
運用這個公式

46
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.450
this is the formula that you might use for this.
兩種數值可以相互轉換

47
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.500
Again, I'm not going to go into too much detail about this specific formula.
同樣地，在此我不會仔細解釋公式的細節

48
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.320
But I just want to point out that it's possible to convert
只是指出不同種類的效果量是可以彼此互換的

49
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.890
one effect size into the other effect size.
只是指出不同種類的效果量是可以彼此互換的

50
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.302
And there are different spreadsheets online if you want to accomplish this.
也有讓你做轉換的網路資源可使用

51
00:02:59.302 --> 00:03:03.067
Now in ANOVA's or regressions, we don't really use the simple correlation but we
在變異數分析或迴歸的場合
通常不會使用相關係數

52
00:03:03.067 --> 00:03:06.698
used R squared or for ANOVA, eta squared, omega squared and epsilon squared.
而是用這張投影片上方四種效果量

53
00:03:06.698 --> 00:03:11.441
This effect size measures that express the proportion of
這些效果量呈現測得的真實效果變異

54
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:15.800
the total variance that's explained by an effect.
佔總變異的比例

55
00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.170
R squared and eta squared are slightly biased effect size estimators.
R平方與eta平方是真實效果量的有偏誤估計值

56
00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.730
And omega squared and epsilon squared are less biased.
別外兩種估計值的偏誤較少

57
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.009
In this case, they are not perfectly unbiased, but they are pretty close.
雖然不是完全不偏，但已經相當接近

58
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.350
It turns out that epsilon squared is least biased effect size measure.
其中最不偏的估計值是epsilon平方

59
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.080
Although omega squared is more often used and more widely recommended.
雖然其中最常用的是Omega平方

60
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.500
Okada, 2013 suggests that this
2013年岡田謙介發表的論文指出

61
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.010
difference might be due to a faulty random number generator in one of the original
原始論文的差異若是來自錯誤的隨機數值

62
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.500
papers that compared these different effect sizes.
很可能導致效果量的估計偏誤

63
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.980
I thought this was funny to point out that even in this kind of simulation work,
這篇論文的有趣之處是即使是模擬研究

64
00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.160
you can have reproducibility problems based on faulty random number generators.
使用不良的隨機數值生產方法也會導致重製性問題

65
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.200
It doesn't matter too much, you can used both omega squared and epsilon squared.
不關這個問題有多嚴重，
建議同時呈現omega平方與eplsilon平方

66
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.690
The difference between the two is actually quite small.
在一般情況，兩者的差異並不大

67
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:12.100
Now conceptually, this effect size measures answer a simple question.
這些效果量的測量都是要回答一個簡單問題

68
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.030
How much does the relationship between x and y reduce the error in the data?
變項x與y的關係要多高，才能減除資料裡的誤差？

69
00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.740
Let's try to visualize this.
我們用視覺化說明這個問題

70
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.350
On the left you can see a model where there is no relationship
左圖的線性模型表示兩個變項之間沒有關係

71
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.710
between the two variables.
左圖的線性模型表示兩個變項之間沒有關係

72
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.740
There's a horizontal line if there's an increase in one variable,
因為水平線的變項數值增加

73
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.580
there is zero increase in the other variable.
另一個變項並無增加

74
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.710
Now we can calculate the sum of squares in this model where there's
把圖上每一對相對於變項間無關係的數值

75
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.150
no relationship between the two variables.
計算數值的平方和

76
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.920
And the red squares indicates the sum of squares.
如圖中的紅色方塊區域所示

77
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.440
So this is the total sum of squares if there's no relationship
這塊面積也是兩變項間的總平方和

78
00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.320
between the two variables.
這塊面積也是兩變項間的總平方和

79
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.000
On the right, we allow for
在右邊的圖

80
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.900
the model to have a relationship between the two variables.
是兩個變項有關係的線性模型

81
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.970
Now if there is an increase in one variable,
其中一個變項的數值增加

82
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.720
we see there is also an increase in the other variable.
另一個變項的數值也隨之增加

83
00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:00.740
We again calculate the sum of squares, now indicated by the blue squares.
同樣計算平方和，正如藍色方塊面積所示

84
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.830
This is the sum of squares of the residuals.
代表殘差的平方和

85
00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.210
And R squared is simply the sum of squares of the residuals divided by
R平方正是殘差的平方和除以總平方和

86
00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.440
the total sum of squares.
R平方正是殘差的平方和除以總平方和

87
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.180
Now if we use effect sizes for power analysis,
用這種效果量做檢定力分析

88
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.420
you'll see that most statistical software asks for Cohen's f.
像G Power需要計算Cohen's f的資訊

89
00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.780
Cohen's f can simply be calculated from eta squared
Cohens' f可使用eta平方

90
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.510
using the formula that's on the screen here.
代入投影片左側的公式計算得出

91
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:32.070
You can also use statistical software to calculate Cohen's f from eta squared.
而G Power也有計算Cohen's f的功能

92
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.190
A screenshot from G power, free statistical software, is on the right.
如何在G Power呼叫這個視窗，請參考本週作業

93
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.800
Now it's important to recognize that if you want to calculate Cohen's
這張投影片示範如何使用G Power
整合效果量和Cohen's f

94
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.760
f within subject design and
這張投影片示範如何使用G Power
整合效果量和Cohen's f

95
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.710
you're using G power, there's something you need to keep in mind.
計算受試者內設計的樣本數

96
00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.372
In within subject designs, G power expects a different version of partial
G Power計算受試者內設計的效果量數值
是以特別公式計算partial eta平方

97
00:05:54.372 --> 00:06:00.470
eta squared than statistical software such as SPSS or R would provide.
而其他統計軟體像SPSS和R
是用另一種公式計算

98
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.995
Now this is great free software, so I'm not complaining.
因為G Power很好用，我對此不予置評

99
00:06:03.995 --> 00:06:07.195
But for some weird reason, these researchers expect
只是有研究者會基於各種理由

100
00:06:07.195 --> 00:06:10.365
a different default than most other statistical software.
希望採用某種軟體的計算結果

101
00:06:10.365 --> 00:06:15.705
This is only a situation if you use power calculations within designs.
受試者內設計的考驗力是各軟體計算差異最大的狀況

102
00:06:15.705 --> 00:06:19.775
In these situations, if you want to directly input eta squared,
如果有需要，你可以在G Power直接輸入
其他軟體計算的partial eta平方

103
00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:23.998
you need to click on the option box that's available on the screen.
在你的G Power視窗中
點選像這個示範截圖的Options按鈕

104
00:06:23.998 --> 00:06:28.889
And if you click in this option box, then you get a specific menu
接著會跳出這個特別選單

105
00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:34.730
where you can say, I want to input partial eta squared as in SPSS.
你可以在選單上選擇要用SPSS的算法

106
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:37.570
Also if you use different types of software such as R,
如果你要用R的算法

107
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:39.820
then this is the option that you want to choose.
也是選同樣的選項

108
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.370
If you forget to highlight this option,
如果你沒有調整選項

109
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.650
then the power calculations might be off quite considerably.
考驗力的計算就照G Power預設執行

110
00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.910
Now very often in experimental designs,
在許多實驗設計案例裡

111
00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.200
you're interested in the partial variance explained by only one factor.
有興趣的通常只有一個因素能解釋的部份變異

112
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.040
For example, a factor that you manipulated.
例如研究者操作的變項

113
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.260
In these situations, you will calculate partial eta squared or again,
這時候可以計算partial eta平方

114
00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:07.830
the less biased partial omega squared or partial epsilon squared.
或者估計值比較不偏的另外兩種

115
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:15.500
Now in a one-way ANOVA, eta squared is identical to partial eta squared.
單因子變異數分析的eta平方等於partial eta平方

116
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.670
So if you're a little bit lazy, you don't have to report this small p,
如果想省點編輯工作，可以不必把下標p打出來

117
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:20.440
you don't have to type it in.
如果想省點編輯工作，可以不必把下標p打出來

118
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.570
It's easier just to say eta squared in this situations.
單因子設計都直接稱呼eta平方

119
00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:31.950
Cohen has provided benchmarks to define small, medium and large Cohen's fs.
Cohen也貼心提供Cohen's f大小判斷標準

120
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:38.010
Cohen's f of 0.1 is small, 0.25 is medium and 0.5 is considered the large effect.
小效果下限0.1，中效果0.25，大效果0.5

121
00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.110
Now we can use the formula that we saw earlier to calculate Cohen's f
還有公式能輕鬆將eta平方等數值轉換成Cohen's f

122
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:46.160
from eta squared or vice-versa.
還有公式能輕鬆將eta平方等數值轉換成Cohen's f

123
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.876
And then we can also create benchmarks for
所以可知eta平方的判斷標準是

124
00:07:49.876 --> 00:07:54.760
eta squared that are small, 0.0099, medium,
小效果至少0.0099

125
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.820
0.0588, and large, 0.1379.
中效果0.0588，大效果0.1379

126
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:02.440
Now this is a lot of digits and this is precision that's not really warranted.
雖然小數點後數字很多，但是不必太精確比較

127
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.430
But this is a consequence of directly converting 
這些數字只是從Cohen's f直接轉換過來的結果

128
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:08.970
the effect sizes that Cohen used into eta squared.
這些數字只是從Cohen's f直接轉換過來的結果

129
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:16.520
Now Cohen talks about eta squared when he defines these benchmarks.
要注意的是
Cohen訂出判斷標準時，表面上說是eta平方

130
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.010
But he actually means partial eta squared.
實際是指partial eta平方

131
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.588
So you should use these benchmarks for partial eta squared, not for
所以這項判斷標準要用在partial eta平方

132
00:08:23.588 --> 00:08:24.910
eta squared itself.
而非eta平方

133
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.230
Another important thing to keep in mind.
請務必記住

134
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:32.750
Nowadays we also see more novel versions of eta squared.
現在還可以使用另一種eta平方

135
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:37.310
And one very useful one, which removes this difference between within and
並且這一種是受試者間與受試者內設計通用

136
00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.460
between subject effect sizes.
並且這一種是受試者間與受試者內設計通用

137
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:44.090
And can generalize between within and between subject designs
這麼好用的效果量稱為通用化eta平方

138
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:48.580
is generalized eta squared, developed by Olejnik and Algina.
由Olenjink與Algina提出


139
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:51.770
Now I just want to point out that this exists.
這種效果量我不細談如何計算

140
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:55.760
If you're interested in reporting effect sizes or if you use the statistical
如果你有興趣使用這種效果量做報告

141
00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.170
software that automatically provides these generalized eta squared values.
或者想知道有什麼軟體可以計算

142
00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.720
They're very useful and might be the best to report.
可以參考原始論文，並且最好在你的報告裡引用

143
00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:08.400
In this lecture, we talked about the R family of effect sizes.
這一講介紹相關係數一類的效果量

144
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.920
Which allow you to quantify the degree of association between two variables.
可計量變項之間的關聯強度

145
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.245
I pointed out some peculiarities when you used eta squared in within
我特別指出使用G Power計算受試者內設計的eta平方

146
00:09:17.245 --> 00:09:20.435
subject designs when you perform power calculations in G power.
應該留意的設定與研究需要的差別

147
00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:24.495
And provided some benchmarks that you can use to interpret these effect sizes if you
還有提供一些這類效果量的大小判斷標準

148
00:09:24.495 --> 00:09:26.299
report them in your result section.
做為你的報告寫作參考

149
00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:31.089
