d類效果量

2
00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:13.580
In the previous lecture, we distinguish between two families of effects sizes.
前一講提到兩大類效果量

3
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.480
Going D Family on the one hand and R Family on the other side.
一種稱為d類，另一種稱為r類

4
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.370
In this lecture we'll take a look at
Cohen's D measures of effect sizes.
這一講學習重點是Cohen's d為主的效果量

5
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.300
Standardized mean, differences.
也就是標準化平均值差異

6
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.980
Let's start with a practical example.
從這個實例開始

7
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.400
Do movie ratings differ between websites?
各大電影評論網站的給分有差異嗎？

8
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.050
And if so, how much?
有得話是多少？

9
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.260
Does it actually matter where you go on the internet
這些給分會反應網路上的眾人的評價嗎？

10
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.100
to see how popular a movie is?
這些給分會反應網路上的眾人的評價嗎？

11
00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.875
Now this is my favorite movie of all time, Fight Club.
拿我最愛的電影「鬥陣俱樂部」來研究吧

12
00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.471
I would definitely rate it a ten, myself, but I can understand that taste
我私心的分數是滿分十分，
但是每個人口味不同，想必有不同的評價

13
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:48.440
differs between people, so there might be some variation.
我私心的分數是滿分十分，
但是每個人口味不同，想必有不同的評價

14
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.570
And there might be a slightly lower average score than ten.
總平均應該會低於十分

15
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.590
Let's take a look at two different websites to see how people have rated
就讓我們看看這部電影在兩個電影網站的大眾評分吧

16
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.090
this movie.
就讓我們看看這部電影在兩個電影網站的大眾評分吧

17
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.691
If we go to the Internet Movie Database,
拿IMDb的資料來看

18
00:01:00.691 --> 00:01:04.655
we see that the score is a remarkably low 8.9, okay.
平均得分是讓我有點心碎的8.9

19
00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:06.428
But if you visit Rotten Tomatoes,
再看爛蕃茄的資料

20
00:01:06.428 --> 00:01:10.540
we see that the score that people gave Fight Club is actually 7.3 out of 10.
網路鄉民給的評價是滿分10分的7.3分

21
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.510
This is actually a big difference if you look at it like this but
兩大網站的評分有很大的差異

22
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.430
we need to quantify this difference to be sure.
因此需要仔細衡量兩者之間的差異

23
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.510
Is this really meaningful or not?
是不是真的反映兩個網站口味不同？

24
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.709
So let's calculate the standardized mean difference to find out.
所以我們要計算兩者的標準化平均值差異

25
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.615
Now we have the two mean values.
現在把兩大網站的平均評分放在一起

26
00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:34.008
On the one hand, the Internet Movie
Database, where the evaluation for
8.9是IMDb的評分，7.3是爛蕃茄的評分

27
00:01:34.008 --> 00:01:39.160
Fight Club is an 8.9, and on Rotten
Tomatoes the average evaluation is a 7.3.
8.9是IMDb的評分，7.3是爛蕃茄的評分

28
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.110
Now conceptually, the standardized mean difference
在統計學裡，標準化平均值差異是

29
00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.240
is the difference in means divided by the standard deviation.
平均值的差異除以標準差

30
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.470
So here we have two means, and we can subtract the one from the other
所以首先把一個平均值減去另一個平均值

31
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.290
to get the mean difference, but we also
need to know the standard deviation.
不過我們還需要知道標準差

32
00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.900
Now luckily, I happen to know that if you look at all movie evaluations that
還好我得知網站的計算方式和原始資料

33
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.860
are being done, the standard deviation is, more or less, 1.4 on these scales.
所以標準差不多不少是1.4

34
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.310
If you have 10 point scale then the standard deviation you can expect if
也就是以10點量表讓網路鄉民評分

35
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.690
people evaluate movies 1.4.
個別差異大約是1.4

36
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.360
So we can have the mean difference and
有了平均值差異和標準差，就能計算效果量

37
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.390
divide it by the standard deviation to calculate the effect size.
有了平均值差異和標準差，就能計算效果量

38
00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.210
In this case,
計算之後

39
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.660
the Cohen's d is a 1.14 which as we'll see later is a very big effect.
得到Cohen's d是1.4
稍後會告訴你這是相當大的效果量

40
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.260
So it really matters which website you go to,
所以IMDb和爛蕃茄給鬥陣俱樂部的評價是很不一樣的

41
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.220
if you want to know whether people like a movie.
所以IMDb和爛蕃茄給鬥陣俱樂部的評價是很不一樣的

42
00:02:33.004 --> 00:02:38.900
A Cohen's d ranges from 0, no effect, to infinity.
Cohen's d的數值可以是0到無限大

43
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.210
When there's no difference between two groups, the mean difference is 0,
沒有差異的話，不論標準差多少，平均值差異都是0

44
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.670
and you can divide it by any
standard deviation you want.
沒有差異的話，不論標準差多少，平均值差異都是0

45
00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.020
The effect size will remain zero.
效果量也會是0

46
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.990
If the difference is really really huge
then the effect size just goes up and up.
如果效果確實巨大，效果量的數值隨差異增加

47
00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.520
Now let's visualize different effect sizes.
讓我們用視覺化方法了解效果量大小的意義

48
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.060
If you don't have any idea of how to interpret an effect size,
有一套評價標準讓你可以推測效果量是大是小

49
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.280
then there are useful benchmarks you can use.
有一套評價標準讓你可以推測效果量是大是小

50
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.335
And in this effect size you can use the benchmarks of 0.2 for small effects.
0.2是小效果量的下限

51
00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:13.349
0.5 for medium effect, and 0.8 for a large effect.
過了0.5就算中效果量
超過0.8就是大效果量

52
00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.171
In this graph, we see the visualization for an effect size of 0.2.
這張圖展示效果量0.2的分配差異

53
00:03:18.171 --> 00:03:23.150
So, clearly there's the difference, people in the one group are slightly more likely
如果把兩個分配當成兩個網站的評分次數分佈

54
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.100
to have a higher score or evaluate a movie a little bit better than the other group
右邊這一群是比左邊的評分稍高

55
00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.250
but you can also see that there's quite a lot of overlap.
不過兩者的重疊比例還是很高

56
00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.050
One individual from one group is very likely
比較高分的這一群

57
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.900
even though they're from this group that on average has a higher evaluation for
即使給的分數接近這一群的平均值

58
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.180
a movie to like the movie less than someone from the other group.
也是比另一群多數人的評分稍低

59
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.320
If we look at the slightly bigger effects size Cohen's d: 0.5
如果效果量增加到0.5

60
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.110
we can see the difference is bigger.
兩個分配的差異也變大

61
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.270
There still quite some overlap.
但還是有很高的重疊比例

62
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.350
And Cohen's d is 0.8 is considered a large meaningful effect.
現在增加到剛剛說的大效果量下限0.8

63
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.800
This is really a big effect size and not many effects in psychology for
如此的效果量數值很少出現在心理學文獻之中

64
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.100
example are as big as this.
如此的效果量數值很少出現在心理學文獻之中

65
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:04.790
And even in this situation there's still quite a lot of overlap.
這張圖裡的兩群重疊比例還是很高

66
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.720
Sometimes you might be tempted to think that if there is a significant result,
概念清楚的研究者會想就算是統計顯著

67
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.370
significant effect.
是否有實質的差異

68
00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.700
Then everybody in one group should score higher than everybody in the other group.
右邊這一群所有人的給分應該比左邊所有人高

69
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.488
But this distributions clearly show that this is not the case.
但是從分配來看似乎不是如此

70
00:04:19.488 --> 00:04:25.770
Even when we have a big effect, groups overlap quite a bit.
就算是有大效果量，還是有重疊的部分

71
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.460
Now using this benchmarks, 'large',
'medium', or 'small' to interpret
剛剛說的小中大效果量判斷標準其實是最後的依據

72
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.120
the size of your effect Should be only be used as a last resort.
剛剛說的小中大效果量判斷標準其實是最後的依據

73
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.670
They're useful if you don't have anything else to go on but,
是你沒有其他可參考的資訊時才要用

74
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.830
it's typically already better to compare the effect size that you found to
一般來說從文獻中找類似研究的效果量更可靠

75
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.490
other related effects in the literature.
一般來說從文獻中找類似研究的效果量更可靠

76
00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.270
You might be able to make a statement such as well compare to
由此比較得到的結論會更站得住腳

77
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.200
this type of intervention.
由此比較得到的結論會更站得住腳

78
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.830
This intervention has a smaller or bigger effect size.
文獻比較能顯示效果量的相對大小

79
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.100
And this is better than just using these benchmarks.
比單純的統計學判斷標準更好

80
00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.390
Sometimes this is not possible and these benchmarks are all you have to go on.
當然沒有文獻可供比較時，還是只能依賴判斷標準。

81
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.860
So interpreting them in the minimum case should require these benchmarks but
請記得這些判斷標準是不得已時才使用

82
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.030
hopefully you can interpret the effect size and
儘可能透過收集文獻數據推測效果量大小的意義

83
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.309
slightly more meaningful way by relating them to effects in the literature.
儘可能透過收集文獻數據推測效果量大小的意義

84
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.260 
So conceptually Cohen's d is the difference divided by the standard
Cohen's d的計算概念是差異值除以標準差

85
00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:22.470
deviation but there are a lot of small variations of Cohen's d
但是標準差的計算取決於獲得資料的研究設計

86
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.470
depending on the design that you use, for example within subject design or
但是標準差的計算取決於獲得資料的研究設計

87
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:28.400
between subject design.
像是受試者內或受試者間設計

88
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.980
There's the Cohen's d for
有的計算方式是用於已知母群參數的

89
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.630
the population if you would know the true value and there's the Cohen's d for
有的計算方式是用於已知母群參數的

90
00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:38.340
the sample if you calculate the effect size based on the sup group.
還有計算方式是用於已知樣本估計值的

91
00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.500
And all these small variations might become a little bit complex but
這些計算公式的差別有些小複雜

92
00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.580
they're important to keep in mind.
但要使用的話必須先分清楚

93
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.300
They differ a little bit and
如果你想仔細了解各種公式的差別
可以看看我的這篇論文

94
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.510
if you want to take a look at this you can look at an article I wrote about this.
如果你想仔細了解各種公式的差別
可以看看我的這篇論文

95
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.310
I don't want to advertise my own work but
我不是故意要打廣告

96
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.800
people apparently seem to find this specific article useful.
而是這篇論文剛好解決這方面的需要

97
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.570
And in this article, I give you all the different formulas for
我在這篇論文列出所有版本的公式及適用條件

98
00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:01.130
these slightly different versions of effect sizes.
我在這篇論文列出所有版本的公式及適用條件

99
00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.080
It's important to keep in mind which effect size you should use,
切記要了解那個公式符合你的研究需求

100
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.130
especially when you perform power calculations.
特別是計算統計檢定力時

101
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.450
So this is a screen shot of g power which you can use to perform a power analysis.
像是G Power裡的效果量欄位裡要填的數值

102
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:17.680
And in this case, we're performing a power analysis for a dependent test.
這個例子是相依樣本檢定的檢定力分析

103
00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.350
There are two groups, but they are dependent.
兩組平均值出自有關聯性的樣本

104
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.360
In this case, G Power asks you to fill in Cohen's dz.
需要在G Power輸入Cohen's dz

105
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.315
So this is one specific way to calculate the standardized mean difference.
為此需要用特別方法計算標準化平均值差異

106
00:06:29.315 --> 00:06:33.495
If you use a different way to calculate the standardized effect size you might get
如果你不是用正確方法計算標準化效果量

107
00:06:33.495 --> 00:06:37.165
an incorrect sample size estimate based on the power analysis.
檢定力分析可能會得到錯誤的樣本數估計值

108
00:06:37.165 --> 00:06:37.905
So keep this in mind.
切記公式的不同

109
00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:46.335
We have a difference between unbiased and biased effect size estimates.
有時候需要效果量的不偏誤估計值

110
00:06:46.335 --> 00:06:49.430
It turns out that if you just calculate Cohen's d.
這時只算Cohen's d是不夠的

111
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.190
It slightly over estimates the true effect size.
因為Choen's d會高估真實效果

112
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.720
Especially when you have small sample sizes,
尤其是樣本數不大的數據

113
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.920
this can be a little bit of a problem.
可能會造成一些問題

114
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.410
Since you're most likely to use computer software to calculate
即然現在幾乎都是用電腦程式計算效果量

115
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:02.960
the effects size anyway.
即然現在幾乎都是用電腦程式計算效果量

116
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.410
It makes sense to always calculate the unbiased version
應該儘可能去計算平均值差異的不偏估計值

117
00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.890
of the d family effect sizes.
應該儘可能去計算平均值差異的不偏估計值

118
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.450
In this case, it's called Hedges' g.
就像Hedges' g

119
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.040
You can see that the g is just Cohen's d multiplied by a small correction.
從公式可看出g等於Cohen's d乘以校正係數

120
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.810
And this correction is only dependent up on the sample size.
這項校正係數由樣本數決定

121
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.440
The larger the sample there's all else no correction.
樣本數越大，校正幅度越小

122
00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:27.760
But if you have a very small sample the difference can be enough to be meaningful.
若是你的資料是小樣本，這樣的校正就有意義

123
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:33.760
You can also calculate effect sizes from the population literature.
也可以使用文獻中的數值計算效果量

124
00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:39.430
It's not always the case that researchers write down what the effect size is,
多數論文不見得會在結果的段落中真接呈現效果量

125
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.410
that they have calculated this effect size and reported it in the results section.
多數論文不見得會在結果的段落中真接呈現效果量

126
00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:45.720
If this is not the case, that's fine.
如果沒有也不必抱怨

127
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.510
In many cases there's enough information in the results section to
多數論文已呈現讀者可以自行計算效果量的資訊

128
00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.160
calculate the effect size yourself.
多數論文已呈現讀者可以自行計算效果量的資訊

129
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.350
For example, Cohen's d can be directly calculated from
像是Cohen's d能用t值與樣本數計算

130
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:58.320
the t value in the t-test and the sample size.
像是Cohen's d能用t值與樣本數計算

131
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:06.180
Cohen's d for a within and a between design differ.
受試者內與受試者間的Cohen's d是不一樣的

132
00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.430
You might have the same mean difference, but
即使平均值差異相同

133
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.670
observations in a within design are correlated.
受試者內的組間觀察值是相關的

134
00:08:11.670 --> 00:08:14.530
This implies that if the correlation is really high,
從公式可看出若觀察值關聯性夠強

135
00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:19.610
the effect size that's calculated based on the observation can be higher in a within
受試者內設計的效果量會高於
受試者間設計的效果量

136
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:24.480
design than in a between design, depending on the strength of the correlation.
受試者內設計的效果量會高於
受試者間設計的效果量

137
00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.900
The difference in the Cohen's d in a within design and
因為兩者間的差異是由這張投影片結尾的係數
所決定

138
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:32.192
a between design is the square root of 2(1- r).
因為兩者間的差異是由這張投影片結尾的係數
所決定

139
00:08:32.192 --> 00:08:36.620
This implies that whenever the correlation between dependent measures is
相依樣本觀察值的相關係數大於0.5時

140
00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.580
larger than 0.5, this difference vector is higher than 1,
差異係數會大於1

141
00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.690
which means the d in a within design would be higher.
使得受試者內設計的效果量提高

142
00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.300
This also means, that the power in such a design is higher.
也代表受試者內設計有較高的檢定力

143
00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.840
In many psychological task, correlations between dependent measures are very high.
許多心理學實驗有很高的相依樣本關聯性

144
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.640
So, very strong correlation which means that very often
相關係數越高表示這種作業採用受試者內設計

145
00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.350
within designs will be more powerful than between designs.
會比受試者間設計有更高的檢定力

146
00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:06.760
We already mentioned that it's important to report and interpret effect sizes.
這一講再次說明報告與解讀效果量的重要性

147
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.700
You can interpret effect sizes in relation to small, medium, and large benchmarks.
我們有判斷標準判別小中大效果量

148
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:15.810
But it's always better to try to interpret these effect sizes in relation to effects
不過根據文獻報告推論效果量之間的差異是最好的

149
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.190
in the literature.
不過根據文獻報告推論效果量之間的差異是最好的

150
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.258
Whenever you use these effects or empower analysis for
不論是不是在檢定力分析使用效果量

151
00:09:20.258 --> 00:09:24.527
example when you report them in your results make sure that you realize their
必須先了解是根據什麼研究設計

152
00:09:24.527 --> 00:09:29.274
small differences within the d family, depending on the design that you've used.
報告與解釋平均值的標準差異

153
00:09:29.274 --> 00:09:33.529
