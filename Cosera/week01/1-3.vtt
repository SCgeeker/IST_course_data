[型一與型二錯誤率]

00:00:08.818 --> 00:00:12.700      
One of the three approaches drawn      
inferences from your data was the path of      
前面提到三種從資料進行推論的法門。第一種是      
付諸行動，正式名稱「尼曼-皮爾生方法」    
    
3  
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.355      
Action, the Limon Pearson approach.      
前面提到三種從資料進行推論的法門。第一種是      
付諸行動，正式名稱「尼曼-皮爾生方法」    
    
4  
00:00:15.355 --> 00:00:19.395      
In the Nymen Pearson approach, the main      
thing is trying to control the errors      
尼曼-皮爾生方法的要訣是控制(每一次)    
推論資料會犯下的錯誤    
      
5  
00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:21.315      
when you draw inferences from your data.     
尼曼-皮爾生方法的要訣是控制(每一次)    
推論資料會犯下的錯誤    
  
6  
00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:23.985      
When you say yes,      
I accept the null hypothesis or      
當你說「我接受虛無假設」      
  
7  
00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:26.315      
I will reject the null hypothesis,     
或者說「我拒絕虛無假設」      
8  
00:00:26.315 --> 00:00:29.915      
controlling the amount of times in     
the long run that you make a mistake.      
都是為了控制多次實驗結論犯錯的次數      
9  
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.270      
Now we talk about this in      
terms of the Type 1 and      
先來談談你會犯的型一與型二錯誤  
是什麼意思    
10  
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.330      
the Type 2 Errors that you can make.     
先來談談你會犯的型一與型二錯誤  
是什麼意思    
11  
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.340      
In the goal of error control,      
what you try to do is prevent      
為了控制犯錯率，首先要避免在多次實驗裡    
犯下太多愚弄自已的錯誤    
12  
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.470      
making a fool out of yourself,     
too often, in the long run and     
為了控制犯錯率，首先要避免在多次實驗裡    
犯下太多愚弄自已的錯誤    
13  
00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.570      
I think this is a very useful thing to try     
when you draw inferences from your data.     
避免這種錯誤經常能讓你從資料做出有效推論      
14  
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.839      
Now let's take a look at an example.     
現在，讓我們看這一個例子      
15  
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.100      
Let's say you're walking down the street     
and you come across this person.     
假想你是(吸血鬼殺手)，在路上巧遇這名男子      
16  
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.220      
And you have some suspicions that      
this person might be a vampire, but      
他的外表讓你懷疑他是吸血鬼還是      
從不出門曬太陽的宅男    
17  
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.090      
it could also be someone who's     
not getting enough sunlight.     
他的外表讓你懷疑他是吸血鬼還是      
從不出門曬太陽的宅男    
18  
00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.250      
You have to make a decision to either      
stake or not stake this individual.      
你的任務是決定要不要拿起尖木棍插入他的心臟      
19  
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.760      
And this person can be a true vampire or     
這名男子也許真的是個吸血鬼      
20  
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.420      
it can just be a random      
person on the street.      
也許只是剛好出門的宅男      
21  
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.950      
So we see that there's     
a possibility that you     
劇情接下來可能會如此發展      
22  
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.450      
correctly identify this person     
as a vampire and stake them.     
你看穿他是真的吸血鬼，並且刺死他      
23  
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.430      
But you can also make an error.      
不過也有可能是錯殺或錯放的劇情      
24  
00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.080      
You can make two types of error.     
也就是型一錯誤與型二錯誤    
  
25  
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.220      
Type one error is, well this is a vampire      
when actually it's not a vampire.      
錯殺的劇情(型一錯誤)：你以為他是吸血鬼    
但其實不是      
26  
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.040      
And in this case you would     
stake an innocent person.      
在這個劇情裡，你殺了無辜的宅男     
(台灣本土劇會演你被家屬追殺)    
27  
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.750      
The second type of error that you      
can make, the type two error is      
錯放的劇情(型二錯誤)：你沒看穿    
他是真正的吸血鬼        
28  
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.790      
saying that this is probably not     
a vampire when it actually is a vampire.     
錯放的劇情(型二錯誤)：你沒看穿    
他是真正的吸血鬼        
29  
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.630      
And in this case,      
you probably going to end up dead,     
這樣的劇情大概會走向你被吸血鬼    
吸光全身血液而死的結局        
30  
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.340      
because this vampire is going to     
suck all the blood out of you.     
這樣的劇情大概會走向你被吸血鬼    
吸光全身血液而死的結局        
31  
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.520      
Let's take a look at some definitions      
when we're talking about this topic.     
接著定義一些待會討論會提到的名詞      
32  
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.550      
So first,      
we have to define the null hypothesis and      
首先定義「虛無假設」與「對立假設」    
通常簡稱H0與H1    
33  
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.010      
the alternative hypothesis,      
which we'll often indicate with H0 and H1.     
首先定義「虛無假設」與「對立假設」    
通常簡稱H0與H1    
34  
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.730      
It's important to keep in      
請記住這個重點        
35  
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.420      
mind that the null hypothesis doesn't      
necessarily need to be the prediction that     
虛無假設並不一定得是預測      
數種實驗情況的差異剛好為零      
36  
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.940      
the difference between certain     
conditions is exactly zero.      
虛無假設並不一定得是預測      
數種實驗情況的差異剛好為零      
37  
00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.090      
Think about flipping a coin, in which      
case the null hypothesis is probably that      
記得前一講提到的擲硬幣例子    
例子裡的虛無假設大概就是      
38  
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.120      
there's a 50% probability of     
flipping heads and tails.      
有50%機率的擲出正面朝上或反面朝上      
39  
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.980      
So the null hypothesis can be anything.      
虛無假設可以是指任何可能結果      
40  
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.900      
But very often,      
只是大多數情況下      
41  
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.180      
it's the idea that there's no difference     
between two experimental conditions.     
剛好是指兩組實驗情境的結果無顯著差異      
42  
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.170      
The alpha that we use as     
the probability of a significant result      
alpha是指我們能夠接受的「拒絕虛無假設，      
43  
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.650      
when the null hypothesis is true.      
但虛無假設實際為真」的犯錯機率      
44  
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.070      
And this is the definition     
of a type 1 error rate.      
這也是型一錯誤的定義      
45  
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.940      
And you're free to set this alpha      
at any level that you want.      
你可以將 alpha定在任何你想要的水準      
46  
00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.263      
A very often used level in psychology is     
5% but we already saw that in some fields      
心理學領域常見的alpha是5%,     
但是不同領域習慣的水準並不相同        
47  
00:02:36.263 --> 00:02:41.289      
like physics it's very common to set     
in much much lower type one error rate.      
前一講提到的物理學    
預訂的型一錯誤率就非常低      
48  
00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:45.175      
And you can also think about areas such as     
medicine where it might be useful to set     
其它講究嚴謹的科學領域，像是醫學    
也習慣把 alpha訂得非常低        
49  
00:02:45.175 --> 00:02:46.750      
a much lower error rate as well.     
其它講究嚴謹的科學領域，像是醫學    
也習慣把 alpha訂得非常低        
50  
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.570      
The beta is the probability      
of a non-significant result,     
beta 指的是犯下「接受虛無假設，但對立假設    
實際為真」的機率      
51  
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.590      
given that the alternative     
hypothesis is true.      
beta 指的是犯下「接受虛無假設，但對立假設    
實際為真」的機率      
52  
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.870      
This is known as a type 2 error.     
也就是型二錯誤        
53  
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.230      
So this is the probability that you'll     
say, there is nothing going on here.     
型二錯誤率代表你宣稱沒有任何實驗效果      
54  
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.300      
When there's actually true     
effects to be observed.      
但是實驗效果並未被觀察到的狀況    
55  
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.030      
If we look at the difference of 1-B,     
this is      
和 (1-Beta)做個比較就知道      
56  
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.790      
the probability of the significant result      
when the alternative hypothesis is true.     
1-Beta是顯示有統計顯著，    
而且對立假設為真的機率      
57  
00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.840      
So this is the statistical power.      
因此1-Beta也被稱為統計考驗力(power)      
58  
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.730      
When you design a study, one minus     
the type two error rate is the probability     
設計研究時計算統計考驗力    
可以用來估計      
59  
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.090      
that you'll actually find the result     
if there is a true effect to be found.     
顯著結果是因為確實發現實際效果的機率      
60  
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.510      
Now remember that Naiman thinks that these     
error rates are frequentist concepts,      
尼曼談論這些錯誤率是根據「次數分配」      
61  
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.990      
so they apply to the long run.     
也就是累積多次重覆實驗結果來看      
62  
00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:38.020      
Now in any single study there's      
either a true effect or not.     
單獨的研究結果，可能會也可能不會    
發現真實效果        
63  
00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.180      
You were right or you were wrong.      
所以一次結果的推論有可能對，也有可能錯      
64  
00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.060      
But these error rates are about      
long-run frequencies.      
但是錯誤率皆是得自持續重覆實驗結果    
推論錯誤次數的累積      
65  
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.810      
So you can be 5% of the time,      
you can make a mistake.      
你可以宣稱這一次的推論    
有平均5%的機率是錯誤的          
66  
00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.460      
But in any single study,     
you've either made a mistake or not.     
對於單一研究結果的推論     
有可能對也有可能錯    
67  
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.370      
It's important to think      
about this in the long run.      
但是請永遠記得這一次的對錯    
只是多次重覆實驗的其中一次           
68  
00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.140      
So if you do many, many studies, how often     
will you make an incorrect conclusion?     
那麼你要如何計算在多次實驗梩      
做出錯誤推論的次數有多少？    
69  
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.910      
Because we have these two situations     
where the null hypothesis is true or     
我們面對兩種可能狀況，推論虛無假設為真      
70  
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.520      
the alternative hypothesis is true,      
或者推論對立假設為真(上兩欄)      
71  
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.340      
and you can either observe a significant     
effect or you will find a non-significant      
還有觀察結果可能是顯著的    
或者不顯著的(左兩欄)      
72  
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.320      
result, we can divide these      
options into these four cells.     
這些情況構成四種可能後果      
(細格之內)    
73  
00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.930      
And here we can see that when      
the null hypothesis is true and      
左上細格就是虛無假設確實為真  
74  
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.230      
you find a significant effect,     
you've made a false positive.      
但發現顯著效果，就犯下假警報的錯誤  
(偽陽性 false positive)        
75  
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.600      
A type I error.      
或者說「型一錯誤」       
76  
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.030      
You said there is something here     
when there are actually nothing.     
表示結論說有效果，但實際是沒有效果        
77  
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.120      
When the null hypothesis true you can also     
correctly say that there is no true effect     
左下細格是虛無假設為真，結論宣稱沒有效果      
78  
00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.190      
which we called a true negative.     
這種後果是正確拒絕     
(true negative 真陰性)    
79  
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.180      
Now in the alternative hypothesis is true.     
再看到右上細格，對立假設為真的情況      
80  
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.750      
You find this significance effect,     
that's a true positive.      
這是發現顯著效果，而且結論命中的後果      
(真陽性 true positive)    
81  
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.050      
Something is going on and      
you correctly identified it.     
也就是宣稱有效果，    
並且真正有效果存在       
82  
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.900      
You can also draw the conclusion     
that there is nothing going on,      
最後右下角是結論沒有效果      
83  
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.660      
when there is actually a true effect.      
但是效果的確存在的「未命中」        
84  
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.090      
And we call this a false negative.     
這種後果就是錯誤否定        
(偽陰性 false nagative)  
85  
00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.010      
Now remember that in any single case     
you're either sampling from a true effect      
稍早已說明一次實驗結果可能是真實效果      
86  
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.300      
or from a false effect.      
或著是錯誤地發現效果      
87  
00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.110      
So you're in one of two parallel worlds.     
虛無與對立假設好比兩個平行世界      
88  
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.420      
Either there is no true effect And     
then you can only make false positives or      
要麼你在虛無假設的世界，在「假警報」      
與「正確否定」兩種推論擇一        
89  
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.850      
true negatives.      
要麼你在虛無假設的世界，在「假警報」      
與「正確否定」兩種推論擇一        
90  
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.250      
Or you're doing research where there is      
actually a true effect and then you can      
不然就是研究確實發現效果，在「命中」     
與「未命中」兩種推論擇一     
91  
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.380      
only make a correct conclusion     
a true positive or a false negative.     
不然就是研究確實發現效果，在「命中」     
與「未命中」兩種推論擇一     
92  
00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.330      
Now let's take this understanding of     
type one errors and type two errors and      
接著運用這張表格列出的型一與型二錯誤，    
命中與正確否定等概念      
93  
00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.170      
true positives and     
接著運用這張表格列出的型一與型二錯誤，    
命中與正確否定等概念      
94  
00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.239      
true negatives to think about what's most      
likely to happen in your next study.     
評估進行一項新研究的結果會遇到什麼後果      
(以下內容建議完成練習測驗再來看一次)    
95  
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.610      
I'll describe a typical situation      
which I think is fair and      
在一個典型的研究裡，    
虛無與對立假設成真的機率相等    
96  
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.530      
describes many of the studies that we do.      
與我們會做的研究大部份相同        
97  
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.850      
Let say, that you don't really know      
if there's a true effect or not.     
也就是說我們並不知道是否    
真的發現真實效果      
98  
00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:39.620      
The null hypothesis might be true, the      
alternative hypothesis might be true and      
虛無假設可能為真    
對立假設也可能為真        
99  
00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.810      
both are equally likely.     
而且兩者為真的機率是相同的      
100  
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.129      
Let's give them both 50%, we just      
don't know what's going to happened.      
所以兩者為真的機率各設定50%    
代表不知道會發現那一種結果        
     
101  
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.330  
We also use a type one error rate,  
同時也像大多數研究一樣    
設定型一錯誤率為5%    
  
102  
00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.310  
the alpha of 5% which is very  
同時也像大多數研究一樣    
設定型一錯誤率為5%    
  
103  
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.610  
And we'll aim for  
statistical power of 80%.  
我們希望統計考驗力有 80%  
  
104  
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.010  
Which means that there is  
a type two error rate of 20%.  
也就是說型二錯誤率為 20%  
  
105  
00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:01.840  
If there is a true effect,  
we will not observe it in 20% on the time.  
代表如果真有效果，    
有20%的機會不會發現顯著結果   
  
106  
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.110  
That's sounds like a lot maybe, but  
80%聽起來很高  
  
107  
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.860  
this is actually a very  
recommended power to aim for.  
然而這是一致推薦要達到的統計考驗力標準    
  
108  
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.140  
So in this specific situation,  
在如此設定的條件下    
  
109  
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.830  
let's assume that this  
reflects what you want to do.  
假設這就是你要完成的研究    
  
110  
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.240  
You use this type 1 error rate.  
你設定這樣的型一錯誤率  
  
111  
00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.780  
And you actually exactly  
meet this statistical power.  
且決定追求這樣的統計考驗力標準  
  
112  
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.990  
You have 80% power in your next study.  
你的新研究結果要根據80%的考驗力推論    
  
113  
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.590  
You never really know but  
let's assume that this is the case.  
雖然你無法確定有達到，    
先姑且如此設定    
  
114  
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.690  
Think a moment what's  
the most likely to happen.  
資料分析完成的那一刻會發生什麼事？    
  
115  
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.000  
Will you find a significant result or  
a non-significant result?  
你會看到顯著的，還是不顯著的結果?  
  
116  
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.160  
Make a false positive or a false negative?  
結論是假警報還是未命中?  
  
117  
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.200  
And let's do the math and  
see what really happens.  
讓我們計算一下各種可能結果的機率    
(完成練習測驗再來看更能理解)    
  
118  
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:42.790  
So as we said, there's a 50% probability  
that a no-hypothesis is true and  
在上方兩欄，    
標記虛無假設為真的機率為50%    
  
119  
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.740    
a 50% probability that    
the alternative hypothesis is true.    
以及標記對立假設為真的機率為50%     
  
120  
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.650    
Remember, we just didn't know    
what was going to happen.    
再次提醒，這表示不曉得何者為真    
  
121  
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.600    
We have a 5% type 1 error rate and    
a 20% type 2 error rate.    
左側兩欄標記型一錯誤率5%  
與型二錯誤率20%    
  
122  
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.660  
So, we can use these numbers to  
calculate the probability of  
如此就能計算四種結果發生的機率    
  
123  
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.530  
each of these four cells to happen, and  
of course, they should add up to 100%.  
並且四者的總和必為100%     
(建議停格親自算一下)    
  
124  
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.700  
Let's first assume that  
the alternative hypothesis is true,  
先來看對立假設為真的這邊    
  
125  
00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.670  
we're examining a true effect.  
這邊代表推論存在真實效果    
  
126  
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.300  
The probability of finding a significant  
effect equals the statistical power that  
發現顯著效果的機率等於統計考驗力(80%)    
乘以對立假設為真的機率(50%)    
  
127  
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:18.220  
we have, which is 80% and its 50% probable  
that the alternative hypothesis is true.  
發現顯著效果的機率等於統計考驗力(80%)    
乘以對立假設為真的機率(50%)    
  
128  
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:20.744  
So we can multiply 80% by 50% and  
所以 80% 乘以 50%就等於40%    
代表結論有效果為正確的機率    
  
129  
00:07:20.744 --> 00:07:25.700  
we find that it's 40% likely that we  
conclude that there's a true effect.  
所以 80% 乘以 50%就等於40%    
代表結論有效果為正確的機率    
  
130  
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.370  
A true positive.  
也有人稱為真陽率    
(true positive)  
  
131  
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.430  
It's also possible that we find  
a non significant effect this will  
右下細格是發現不顯著的結果    
  
132  
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:31.820  
happen 20% of the time.  
有20%的機率發生     
  
133  
00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.310  
Multiplying 20% with the 50% probability  
of the alternative hypothesis being true  
所以將20%乘以50%的對立假設為真的機率  
  
134  
00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.380  
gives us a 10% probability  
of making a false negative.  
就會得到10%推論未命中的機率  
(偽陰率)    
  
135  
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.420  
Now let's move over to the situation  
where the null hypothesis is true.  
現在把目光移到虛無假設為真的這一欄    
  
136  
00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:46.880  
Here we have a 5% error rate.  
統計顯著的結果有5%的犯錯率    
  
137  
00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:53.730  
We can multiply this 5% times the 50%  
probability of the no hypothesis  
將5%乘以50%的虛無假設為真的機率，    
  
138  
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:56.730  
is true and in 2.5% of the time we'll  
conclude that there's a false positive.  
得到做出結論為假警報的機率是2.5    
(偽陽率)    
  
139  
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.540  
We'll say that there is an effect when  
there's actually no effect to be found.  
也就是說，不存在真實效果    
結論卻認為存在的機率    
  
140  
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.658  
And now we come to the most likely outcome  
in this very typical situation, a true.  
最後左下角是這個研究最可能發生的推論結果    
  
141  
00:08:05.658 --> 00:08:12.140    
There's a 95% probability that will    
conclude that nothing is going on.    
首先有95%的機率沒有發現顯著效果      
  
142  
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:16.580  
Multiply it by the 50%  
probability that the null  
乘以50%的虛無假設為真的機率    
  
143  
00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.850  
hypothesis is true which gives us 47.5%.  
得到47.5%的機率  
  
144  
00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:21.550  
So that's the highest number of  
these four possible outcomes.  
而且是這四種結果推論最有可能發生的    
  
145  
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.710  
And this might be surprising  
if you do a new study and  
你也許會很驚訝，如果一項新研究    
不知虛無還是對立假設何者為真    
  
146  
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.400  
you don't know whether the null is true or  
the alternative is true,  
你也許會很驚訝，如果一項新研究    
不知虛無還是對立假設何者為真    
  
147  
00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.410  
you use the recommended alpha level and  
the recommended statistical power.  
使用建議的 alpha 值與統計考驗力標準    
  
148  
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:36.450  
Then the most likely outcome of  
your next study is a true negative.  
最有可能的結果竟然是正確拒絕    
(真陰率)    
  
149  
00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:39.700  
Nothing is going on and you correctly  
conclude that nothing is going on.  
什麼效果都沒有是最有可能正確的結論    
  
150  
00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:45.200  
So you might be surprised that the most  
likely outcome is a true negative, and  
所以你也許會驚訝，正確拒絕竟然是多次實驗    
最常出現的正確結論，卻不是最令人感興趣的    
  
151  
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.550  
very often, your interested in  
finding significant effect and  
所以你也許會驚訝，正確拒絕竟然是多次實驗    
最常出現的正確結論，卻不是最令人感興趣的    
  
152  
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.440  
finding support for  
the alternative hypothesis.  
支持對立假設的顯著結果    
  
153  
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.330  
Saying, there is a true effect and  
比方說確實有真實效果    
  
154  
00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.780  
correctly concluding that  
there is a true effect.  
而且已有研究支持確實存在    
  
155  
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.800  
So how can you improve these  
probabilities in the previous slides?  
那麼要如何改進前一張投影片例子的四種結果    
之間的相對機率    
  
156  
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.020  
Well there are different options.  
其實有不少可行方案   
     
157  
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.580  
Let's take a look at what works best.  
讓我們來看一下怎樣能得到最好的效果  
  
158  
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:08.640  
You might say, the problem here is  
probably that I only had 80% power.  
你也許想，現在的問題是我只有80%的統計考驗力  
  
159  
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:12.190  
When there is a true effect,  
I only had an 80% probability  
也就是有真實效果時，我只有80%的機率  
  
160  
00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.830  
of finding the effect when it's there, and  
I need to increase my statistical power.  
能真正發現它，所以需要增加統計考驗力  
  
161  
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.730  
Now in this slide you can  
see the red numbers and  
這張投影片的紅色數字  
  
162  
00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:21.260  
we have increased the power to 99 percent.  
就是把考驗力增加到99%  
  
163  
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:25.690  
Which means that almost all of the time,  
you correctly conclude  
幾乎等於說，如果真實效果存在的話  
你都能正確地做出結論  
  
164  
00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:28.600  
that there is an effect when there  
is a true effect to be observed.  
幾乎等於說，如果真實效果存在的話  
你都能正確地做出結論  
  
165  
00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.700  
Our true positive rate  
has indeed increased.  
正陽率的確因此增加    
(40% => 49.5%)  
166  
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.260  
But not so much.  
但是不明顯    
(9.5%)  
  
167  
00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.180  
You can see that now  
it's about 94.5% likely  
你看得出，現在有49.5%的機率    
(Daniel口誤)    
  
168  
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:40.060  
that you conclude that  
there's a true positive.  
正確地推論有命中真實效果    
  
169  
00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.380  
It is now the most likely outcome but  
it's not ridiculously high.  
雖然是四者最有可能的結果，    
比正確拒絕高不了多少    
  
170  
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.180  
Another idea you might have is say,  
另外一個你可能會想到的辦法是    
  
171  
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.320  
well probably the false  
positive rate is too high.  
也許偽陽率太高了    
  
172  
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.040  
Let's reduce the false positive rate.  
那就設法降低吧    
  
173  
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.110  
Set it at 1%.  
把alpha設為1%     
  
174  
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:56.550  
So Type 1 error is now 1%.  
所以現在型一錯誤率為1%    
  
175  
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.260  
And you can see where changes occur.  
可以看到虛無假設為真的這欄    
也就是假警報與正確拒絕的發生率有改變    
  
176  
00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.360  
Now of course the difference is only  
in the situation when null hypothesis is  
可以看到虛無假設為真的這欄    
也就是假警報與正確拒絕的發生率有改變    
  
177  
00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.610  
actually true.  
可以看到虛無假設為真的這欄    
也就是假警報與正確拒絕的發生率有改變    
  
178  
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:08.970  
Because you can only make a Type 1  
error if the null hypothesis is true.  
因為型一錯誤只與虛無假設為真有關    
  
179  
00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:13.610  
So we see that there's a reduction in  
the number of false positives from 2.5%.  
偽陽率很明顯地從2.5%降到0.5%    
  
180  
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:16.020  
Now it's only 0.5%.  
偽陽率很明顯地從2.5%降到0.5%    
  
181  
00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.520  
But still,  
true negatives are most likely to happen.  
然而正確拒絕依然是最可能正確的推論    
  
182  
00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:21.840  
So this all doesn't really help.  
所以只改變型一或型二錯誤率效果不大      
  
183  
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.670  
So whats the most important thing  
to do if you want to improve  
所以想要增加真陽率的話，    
到底該怎麼做的呢?    
  
184  
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:26.650  
the probability of  
finding a true positive?  
所以想要增加真陽率的話，    
到底該怎麼做的呢?    
  
185  
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.370  
What you should do is examine  
hypotheses that are likely to be true.  
治本之道是檢查實驗效果存在的假設    
  
186  
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.620  
The biggest problem here is this  
50/50 prior probability of the null and  
真正關鍵是虛無假設與對立假設    
為真的先驗機率比例(50%/50%)    
  
187  
00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.430  
the alternative hypothesis being true.  
真正關鍵是虛無假設與對立假設    
為真的先驗機率比例(50%/50%)    
    
188  
00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.070    
We can see that if it's above    
90% probable that we are right.    
如果對立假設為真的先驗機率提高到90%      
  
189  
00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:48.420    
That our hypothesis is 90% likely to    
be true when we start data collection.    
也就是蒐集資料之前，就知道對立假設為真的機率是90%  
  
190  
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.520  
You can see that the probability of  
a true positive increases sharply.  
如此一來的結論命中率會大大的提高    
  
191  
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.870  
Now, I always use these calculations  
whenever a masters student    
每當有碩士班學生到我辦公室    
吿訴我說：「我有一個瘋狂的好點子，    
  
192  
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.610  
enters my office and says,  
I have a crazy idea.  
每當有碩士班學生到我辦公室    
吿訴我說：「我有一個瘋狂的好點子，    
  
193  
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.090  
I don't know if it's true or  
not, but this is my passion,  
我不知能不能真的發現，    
但是我願意付出時間精力    
  
194  
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.180  
this is something that I really find  
interesting and I want to examine it.  
我真的很想要做這個研究。」    
我總是做一次這些計算給他看。    
  
195  
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.190  
I always say, that's perfectly fine.  
我總是回答，你的點子很好    
  
196  
00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.020  
But I don't know if  
the hypothesis is true or not.  
但我不知道這個假設是否為真    
  
197  
00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.560  
It's 50/50.  
先驗機率比是 50/50    
  
198  
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.810    
Could go either way.    
任何結果都有可能    
  
199  
00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:17.430  
So realize that the most likely outcome  
of your research is a true negative.    
你必須瞭解這個情況最有可能的正確結果就是    
正確拒絕存在真實效果     
  
200  
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:19.750  
If you're interested in finding.  
如果你真有想法找到支持對立假設為真的證據    
  
201  
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.597  
Support for the alternative hypothesis,  
the best thing you can do is examine  
如果你真有想法找到支持對立假設為真的證據    
  
202  
00:11:23.597 --> 00:11:27.343  
studies that are, or examined hypotheses  
that are most likely to be true.  
最好從己知有可能為真的假設下手    
  
203  
00:11:29.944 --> 00:11:33.684  
Now let's use a slightly different way  
to think about these type one errors and  
現在讓我們透過視覺化來看型一與型二錯誤    
以及命中與正確拒絕的推論成功率    
  
204  
00:11:33.684 --> 00:11:37.190  
type two errors and  
true positives and true negatives.  
現在讓我們透過視覺化來看型一與型二錯誤    
以及命中與正確拒絕的推論成功率    
  
205  
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:40.100  
This is an illustration of  
the null hypothesis and  
虛無假設與對立假設的機率分配都設定符合常態分配    
  
206  
00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:43.750  
the alternative hypothesis in  
terms of normal distributions.  
虛無假設與對立假設的機率分配都設定符合常態分配    
  
207  
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.880  
You can visit this website and play around  
with this visualization if you want to.  
你可以透過右下角連結到這個網頁自己玩玩看    
  
208  
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:52.390  
Let's look at all the different components  
here because there's quite a lot of  
視覺化包裝許多訊息，需要花點時間看一下各種組成成份    
  
209  
00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:53.750  
information.  
視覺化包裝許多訊息，需要花點時間看一下各種組成成份    
  
  
210  
00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:59.600  
Now the white bell shaped curve Is the  
situation when the null hypothesis is true.  
投影片裡白色鐘型曲線是指虛無假設為真的部分  
  
211  
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.080  
When there is no true  
effect to be observed.  
代表實驗結果不會觀察到真實效果的情況    
  
212  
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:04.540  
You can see that it centered at zero.  
你可以看到它的中央點是為0  
  
213  
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.280  
So, this reflects the situation  
where the null hypothesis is true,  
所以這個分配包含虛無假設為真的所有情況    
  
214  
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.740  
there is no true effect but,  
there are some random variation.  
表示沒有任何效果存在，但有一些隨機誤差    
  
215  
00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.840  
Now, if we take a look a light  
blue bell shaped curve  
再來看淡藍的鐘型曲線    
  
216  
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.540  
This is the distribution when  
there is a true effect and  
這是代表真實效果存在的機率分配    
  
217  
00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:22.368  
in this case there's a true effect  
of a specific size, namely 0.35.  
這個範例的真實效果量是0.35  
  
218  
00:12:22.368 --> 00:12:25.560  
We'll talk about effect sizes  
later in the course, but for  
我們在後面的課程裡會再討論到效果量    
  
219  
00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.660  
now you can see that the likelihood  
of finding effects that are large  
不過可以看到在對立假設分配發現這個效果    
的似然性是相當高的    
  
220  
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.680  
is much more likely under  
the alternative hypothesis.  
不過可以看到在對立假設分配發現這個效果    
的似然性是相當高的    
  
221  
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.523  
And under the null hypothesis you'll  
find effect sizes that are zero most of  
在虛無假設的機率分配裡，  
發現的效果量多數接近零  
  
222  
00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:43.386  
the time. There's a certain  
critical value that we often use,  
我們通常會設定一個臨界值(critical value)    
  
223  
00:12:43.386 --> 00:12:48.582  
it's also illustrated here, and in this  
case, this equals a p value of 0.05.  
在這個範例裡對應p值等於.05    
  
224  
00:12:48.582 --> 00:12:51.980  
So this is the critical value,  
your type one error rate.  
所以這個臨界值也等於型一錯誤率    
  
225  
00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.670  
Now given this cutoff  
off the distributions,  
從這個臨界值切下去的兩個分配    
  
226  
00:12:56.670 --> 00:13:00.330  
we can make a division between the four  
cells that we saw earlier, but  
分成了四個部分，對應到我們先前提到的四個細格    
  
227  
00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.160  
now we're visualizing it in another way.  
也就是圖中的四塊顏色區域    
  
228  
00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.190  
If we look at the white bell shaped curve  
白色的鐘型曲線之下的白色區域    
就是正確拒絕(正陰性)    
  
229  
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:09.990  
the white area reflects  
the true negatives.  
白色的鐘型曲線之下的白色區域    
就是正確拒絕(正陰性)    
  
230  
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:13.890  
There is no true effect to be observed and  
we will find it a lot of the time.  
這一塊表示不會觀察到真實效果，也是四塊區域最大的    
  
231  
00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.500  
We can also make a false positive.  
紅色區域代表假警報的發生率    
  
232  
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:22.670  
This is still part of  
the distribution Often null, so  
這塊也是虛無假設的一部分  
  
233  
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:28.350  
the white curve slowly moves towards  
this red are that you can see.  
所以白色鐘型曲線向紅色區域緩慢傾斜    
  
234  
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:31.670  
WIth the area of the false  
positives pointing to it.  
紅色區域面積代表結論是假警報發生機率    
  
235  
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.770  
These are situations when we  
observe an extreme result  
代表虛無假設為真時，我們會觀察到極端結果的狀況    
  
236  
00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.810  
when the null hypothesis is true.  
代表虛無假設為真時，我們會觀察到極端結果的狀況    
  
237  
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:41.390  
We're saying that there's something, but  
we're actually making a type one error  
這些狀況下宣稱有效果，就是犯了型一錯誤    
  
238  
00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:44.430  
Now let's switch our attention  
to the light blue area.  
接著來看淡藍色的區域    
  
239  
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:48.100  
You can see that this falls on  
the right side of the critical value.  
這塊區域位於臨界值的右邊    
  
240  
00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:52.780  
So in this case, we are observing p  
values that are smaller than 0.05 and  
這代表如果觀察到的p值小於.05    
並且宣稱有效果的結論是正確的情況    
  
241  
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.220  
we are correctly saying  
that there is an effect.  
這代表如果觀察到的p值小於.05    
並且宣稱有效果的結論是正確的情況    
  
242  
00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.990  
We're observing a significant result and  
there is a true effect to be observed.  
這個情況有顯著結果，而且確實觀察到真實效果    
  
243  
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:03.270  
So the light blue area corresponds to  
the true positives that we'll observe.  
所以淡藍色區域對應於推論命中的結果    
(正陽性)    
  
244  
00:14:04.390 --> 00:14:07.060  
Sometimes we'll conclude  
that there is no effect  
有時我們也會下結論說，沒有任何效果存在    
  
245  
00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:11.360  
when we're actually sampling from this  
reality where this a true effect.  
實際上資料取樣自有效果的分配    
  
246  
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.600  
This is illustrated in the dark blue area.  
這就是深藍色區域代表的情況    
  
247  
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.150  
These are false negatives.  
也就是未命中的推論(偽陰性)    
  
248  
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:18.080    
The values we observe    
are not extreme enough    
這種情況獲得的資料不能獲得小於.05的p值    
因此導致未命中的推論    
  
249  
00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.790  
to lead to a P value smaller than 0.05 So  
these are false negatives.  
這種情況獲得的資料不能獲得小於.05的p值    
因此導致未命中的推論    
  
250  
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:28.820  
Now the important question  
when you're designing a study is,  
現在回到最重要的問題    
設計一個研究要如何設定結論的犯錯率？    
  
251  
00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:31.320  
which error rates should you aim for?  
現在回到最重要的問題    
設計一個研究要如何設定結論的犯錯率？    
  
252  
00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:36.380    
I already mentioned that the alpha      
level and the beta that we often use     
一開始曾提過心理學常設定    
alpha是0.05,beta值是20%或者考驗力80%    
    
253  
00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:42.024    
is alpha 0.05 and the beta of 20% or    
a statistical power of 80%.    
一開始曾提過心理學常設定    
alpha是0.05,beta值是20%或者考驗力80%    
  
254  
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.490  
However statisticians themselves say  
you should not use these benchmarks.  
然而統計學家建議你不應該依賴這些參照標準    
  
255  
00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:52.370  
You should think for  
yourself what the best choice is.  
你應該自己想想，什麼是你的最佳選擇    
  
256  
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.310  
Neyman himself talks about it in this way.  
至少尼曼是這麼表示的    
  
257  
00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.260  
Is it more serious to convict  
an innocent man, or to acquit a guilty?  
他曾問「起訴一個無辜的人，與釋放一個罪犯，    
那個較嚴重?」    
  
258  
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:03.290  
if you're convicting an innocent man,  
this person has done nothing.  
如果你是檢察官，要起訴一個無辜的人，  
但這人並沒做惡事    
  
259  
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.110  
But you're saying this person has done  
something, so this is Type 1 error.  
你堅持這個人有罪，    
就犯了型一錯誤    
  
260  
00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:10.490  
If you're acquitting a guilty man,  
this person has done something wrong.  
如果你決定釋放一個嫌犯，但這個人真做了惡事    
  
261  
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.790  
But you're saying no crime has been  
committed, so this is Type 2 error.  
你堅持這個人無罪，    
就犯了型二錯誤    
  
262  
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:18.579    
Depending on your beliefs one of these two    
types of errors might be more serious.    
那種錯誤較嚴重，端看你的信念    
  
263  
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:21.720  
In the case of medicine,  
在醫學領域裡    
  
264  
00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.010  
we can see that you have to weigh this  
two types of error very carefully.  
兩種錯誤是以非常謹慎方式權衡    
  
265  
00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.480  
If you have Type 2 error and  
you are saying, you are not sick.  
如果你是醫生卻犯了型二錯誤    
也就是你覺得患者並未生病    
  
266  
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:32.520  
You don't need any treatment when  
the person is actually sick.  
不需要任何治療    
但事實上患者是有病的    
  
267  
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:35.350  
There might be very severe consequences  
and this person might die.  
這可能會導致患者死亡的嚴重後果    
  
268  
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.630  
So there are more likely to  
make an error whether you say,  
因此寧可犯另一種的錯誤  
  
269  
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:42.080  
you might have a specific sickness,  
we're not completely sure.  
也就是患者真有某種疾病，    
只是還無法確切診斷    
  
270  
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:46.487  
And then follow up research will  
confirm this in more extensive tests.  
然後持續研究，根據更廣泛的測試結果做結論    
  
271  
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:54.179  
So Neyman himself says that determining  
how the balance must be struck should be  
所以尼曼表示，如何決定兩種錯誤的平衡點    
應該要讓研究者自己決定    
  
272  
00:15:54.179 --> 00:15:56.480  
left to the investigator.  
所以尼曼表示，如何決定兩種錯誤的平衡點    
應該要讓研究者自己決定    
  
273  
00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:59.340  
So it's up to you to decide  
what types of errors or  
你(研究者)自已應該最清楚要避免那種錯誤    
還有容許多大的犯錯率    
  
274  
00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:02.470  
what levels of errors you find acceptable.  
你(研究者)自已應該最清楚要避免那種錯誤    
還有容許多大的犯錯率    
  
275  
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:07.140  
You don't really need to use these  
defaults although they are very tempting.  
雖然預設標準很方便       
但你並非一定得採用    
  
276  
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:11.160  
Cohen himself recommended  
this 80% power threshold.  
就像柯恩(Jacob Cohen)建議的80%統計考驗力  
  
277  
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.813  
And when he did this, he explicitly hoped  
that this recommendation would be ignored  
他同時提到，若是研究者清楚知道自己要的考驗力    
是多少，可忽略這項建議    
  
278  
00:16:15.813 --> 00:16:19.559  
whenever you as a researcher can  
make better informed judgements.  
他同時提到，若是研究者清楚知道自己要的考驗力    
是多少，可忽略這項建議    
  
279  
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:26.360  
At our department for example, we use  
typically a 90% power if we're designing  
以我任教的系來說，我們一般採用90%的統計考驗力    
  
280  
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.530  
new studies where we hope that they will  
lead to insights that we can publish.  
來設計新研究，尤其是能導致可發表的新想法的研究      
  
281  
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:35.600  
So, we have a 90% threshold because we try  
to spend the tax money on research that  
採用至少90%的考驗力是希望善用納稅人的錢做出    
真正有意義的結果，就算沒發現顯著結果也ok    
  
282  
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.830    
will give us informative results, even    
when we don't find a significant result,    
採用至少90%的考驗力是希望善用納稅人的錢做出      
真正有意義的結果，就算沒發現顯著結果也ok    
  
283  
00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:42.650  
we want to be reasonably sure that  
there's really nothing there,  
我們講究即使沒有任何效果存在    
也不要錯過任何蛛絲馬跡      
  
284  
00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:43.890  
that we didn't miss anything.  
我們講究即使沒有任何效果存在    
也不要錯過任何蛛絲馬跡      
  
285  
00:16:43.890 --> 00:16:48.270  
In the case where you're  
examining very impactful things,  
如果是檢視有重大意義的發現    
  
286  
00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:52.370  
where, if you find an effect,  
you might have a real breakthrough.  
特別是可能導致科學突破的某種效果    
更要避免未命中的錯誤    
  
287  
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:55.490  
So, missing out on a true  
effect is very costly.  
我們的考量是錯過發現真實效果是非常划不來的    
  
288  
00:16:55.490 --> 00:17:00.690  
You want to increase your power or reduce  
your type two error as much as possible  
必須儘可能增加統計考驗力，    
或者降低型二錯誤    
  
289  
00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:04.810  
Most of the scientific discoveries that  
lead to Nobel prizes are discovered by  
大多數諾貝爾獎得主的重要發現，都是在35~40歲左右    
  
290  
00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:08.350  
people between 35 and 40 years of age. So  
大多數諾貝爾獎得主的重要發現，都是在35~40歲左右    
  
291  
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:12.520  
in my case I'm of course keeping my type  
two error rate as small as possible.  
所以我當然要儘量降低型二錯誤    
  
292  
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:16.090  
Because at this moment when I do  
a discovery and I miss out on something,  
如果我的研究過程漏掉了某個重要發現    
  
293  
00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:20.200  
I could may be even be missing out  
on a Nobel prize winning idea.  
我可能會失去一個得諾貝爾獎的絕佳機會    
  
294  
00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:24.170  
So for me personally, I try to have  
high power and low type two error rates.  
就對我個人而言，最佳策略是提高統計考驗力    
降低型二錯誤率    
  
295  
00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.810  
The type one error rate is  
slightly less important.  
型一錯誤就相對來說並沒有那麼重要    
  
296  
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.030  
At the same time,  
we see that people are very,  
另一方面，常看到很研究者非常不喜歡    
  
297  
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:35.790  
very hesitant to changeType 1 error rates.  
或者抗拒調整型一錯誤率    
  
298  
00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:36.970  
You could even increase it.  
其實你可以增加型一錯誤率    
  
299  
00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:40.978  
You could set your Type 1 error rates  
to 10% and it's perfectly possible,  
只要是你的研究條件允許     
將型一錯誤率提高到10%也是可以接受的  
  
300  
00:17:40.978 --> 00:17:44.290  
If in your specific situation,  
this is acceptable.  
只要是你的研究條件允許     
將型一錯誤率提高到10%也是可以接受的  
  
301  
00:17:44.290 --> 00:17:48.320  
But it's almost like Moses came  
down from the Mount Sinai and  
不過預設標準很像是摩西從西奈山帶出來    
刻有十誡的石板    
  
302  
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.940  
he had this tablet with  
a ten commandments and  
不過預設標準很像是摩西從西奈山帶出來    
刻有十誡的石板    
  
303  
00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.240  
one of them was you will  
always set your alpha to 0.05.  
彷彿其中一誡是：把你的alpha 設在.05    
  
304  
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.710  
People are very hesitant to change this  
but if you really know what you're  
人們非常不想去改變這個值。    
但是若你真正知道你在做什麼    
  
305  
00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:03.860  
doing and you're making an informed  
judgement, this is perfectly possible.  
並且是深思熟慮後的決定，    
改變alpha值是完全可行的    
  
306  
00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.920  
So it's very useful to think  
about how you can control your  
當你設計一項新研究時，    
思考如何控制兩種錯誤率是非常有用的    
  
307  
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.340  
error rates when you're  
designing a new study.  
當你設計一項新研究時，    
思考如何控制兩種錯誤率是非常有用的    
  
308  
00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:13.118  
You want to minimize one or  
both of these types of errors, so  
你要降低一種或兩種犯錯率，    
才能讓減少多次實驗被愚弄的機會    
  
309  
00:18:13.118 --> 00:18:17.679  
that in the long run, you won't make  
a fool out of yourself too often.  
你要降低一種或兩種犯錯率，    
才能讓減少多次實驗被愚弄的機會    
  
310  
00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:22.089
