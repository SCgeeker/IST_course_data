2  
00:00:09.127 --> 00:00:14.460  
Hi, welcome to this course where we'll try  
to improve your statistical inferences.  
歡迎加入「升級你的統計推論功力」  
  
3  
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.720  
My name is Daniel Lakens,  
I'm an experimental psychologist working  
我是Daniel Lakens，我是一位實驗心理學家  
現在是埃因霍溫科技大學HTI學群專任教師

  
4  
00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.160  
at the Human-Technology Interaction group  
at Eindhoven University of Technology.  
我是Daniel Lakens，我是一位實驗心理學家  
現在是埃因霍溫科技大學HTI學群專任教師

5
00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.550
Now, some years after I completed my Ph.D,
I realized that my understanding of
幾年前我拿到博士學位之後，我發覺

6
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.980
statistics was actually not good
enough to design a proper study.
我對統計學的認識太少
不足以設計良好的研究

7
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.580
I joined the Reproducibility Project
我曾參與2015年重製100項心理學實驗

8
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.040
which has the goal to reproduce
100 studies in psychology.
的跨國合作專案
(參考https://osf.io/ezcuj/)

9
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.690
And when I started to perform
the replication study that I would do,
當我開始進行重製研究時

10
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.940
I realized that I had to
calculate an effect size
我必須先計算效果量(effect size)

11
00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.430
to perform an a priori power analysis.
以及進行事前考驗力分析

12
00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.264
Now, this is a very basic first
step when you design a new study,
今天無論進行全新的研究或重製研究

13
00:00:52.264 --> 00:00:57.238
whether it's a completely new study or
a replication study, it doesn't matter.
都是第一步必做的功課

14
00:00:57.238 --> 00:00:59.447
I realized I didn't really
know how to do this.
但是以前我並不曉得如何做

15
00:00:59.447 --> 00:01:02.708
And then I wondered, well,
if I don't know to do this very first,
後來我醒悟，如果不知道如何做這些基本功課

16
00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:06.180
basic thing,
how can I ever collect informative data?
我要怎麼收集真正有意義的資料？

17
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.590
Since then, I've been looking into how to
improve the way that we design studies and
從那之後，我深入學習增進設計研究的能力

18
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.910
draw inferences from data.
以及運用資料進行推論的正確方法

19
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.000
I published some papers on this, and
我發表過幾篇研究設計與統計推論的論文
(請見各週課程概要Overview)

20
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.430
I've realized that improving the
statistical understanding of how you do
我了解提昇統計推論的能力可以幫助你
成為做事更有效，更講究品質的研究者

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.070
research really makes you a more
efficient and better researcher.
我了解提昇統計推論的能力可以幫助你
成為做事更有效，更講究品質的研究者

22
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.950
So I'll share some of the insights I had,
and I'll try to prevent some confusion
所以我要分享我的收穫，以及幫助你
減輕使用R語言等統計工具時遇到的困擾

23
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.040
that you might have about
statistical tools that we use.
所以我要分享我的收穫，以及幫助你
減輕使用R語言等統計工具時遇到的困擾

24
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.460
The goal of this is to try to
prevent you from fooling yourself.
這門課的目標是幫助你避免在研究過程中
愚弄自已

25
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.130
As Feynman reminds us, the first principle
in doing science is that you must not fool
如同物理學家費曼先生的提醒：
從事科學的首要原則是避免愚弄自己

26
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.850
yourself- and
you are the easiest person to fool.
因為自己就是最容易被自己愚弄的人

27
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.360
So I see a better understanding
of statistics as a very good way
提昇對統計學的認識就是
避免愚弄自己的可行之道

28
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.620
to try to prevent you
from fooling yourself.
提昇對統計學的認識就是
避免愚弄自己的可行之道

29
00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.440
Now, as an experimental researcher, the
goal might not be to do statistical tests,
身為一位實驗科學家，首要目的並不是做統計檢定

30
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.010
itself.
身為一位實驗科學家，首要目的並不是做統計檢定

31
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.830
What you always want to do is
to say something about a theory.
而是根據某種理論提出解釋

32
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.190
So the goal of data collection is to
first draw statistical inferences and
收集資料的目標是先進行統計推論

33
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.400
then to draw theoretical inferences.
再進行理論推論

34
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.220
That's what you really want to know.
這類課程一開始都會先這樣的告知

35
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.690
But, of course, you need to draw a good
and valid statistical inferences
當然，統計推論必須要可信而且有效

36
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.530
because otherwise the next
step doesn't really work.
否則理論推論無法成立

37
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.236
So let's try to improve this step.
就讓我們由此踏上升級之路吧

38
00:02:20.028 --> 00:02:23.797
There's a reason why psychologists,
maybe scientists more generally,
今天的心理學家還有更多科學家
有許多好理由提昇自己的統計推論能力

39
00:02:23.797 --> 00:02:27.165
are now really interested in
improving statistical inferences.
今天的心理學家還有更多科學家
有許多好理由提昇自己的統計推論能力

40
00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:31.813
And one of the first reasons for
starting on this improvement cycle was
其中一個理由是從康乃爾大學資深教深

41
00:02:31.813 --> 00:02:35.060
a study published by
Daryl Bem on precognition.
Daryl Bem的預知能力研究開始

42
00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.080
Precognition is the idea that
we can predict the future.
預知能力(precognition)就是人類
具有預測未來的能力

43
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.080
Now, you might believed that
this is possible or not, but
不論你相信或者不相信

44
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.190
as a scientist we should always keep
an open mind and look at the evidence.
身為科學家必須對被提出來的證據
保持開放的心胸

45
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.710
In this case, there was a set of nine
published studies that all showed
這份研究報告了九項實驗的結果

46
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.990
support for the idea that people
could predict the future.
而且一致支持人類具有預知能力

47
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.570
There were very simple basic tasks that
were performed that are widely used in
這些實驗都是實驗心理學常用的簡單作業

48
00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.380
experimental psychology, but
the tasks were always reversed.
不過這份研究裡作業步驟都做了調整

49
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.680
So instead of first seeing a picture and
then pressing a button to
像是不用看到圖片再辨識

50
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.740
categorize the picture, the task was
presented in the reversed order.
而是請參與者看到之前就要辨識

51
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.890
People first had to press a button, and
only then the picture would emerge.
參與者按下按鍵之後，圖片才會浮現

52
00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.430
So, of course,
想當然爾

53
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.678
you don't really know what to press
unless you can predict the future.
你必須有預知能力才曉得該按什麼鍵

54
00:03:19.678 --> 00:03:21.150
And in this set of studies,
在這九項實驗裡

55
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.490
people were able to perform above guessing
average in most of these studies.
參與者的平均表現都比隨便猜的情況好

56
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.561
So after this, maybe some people
thought precognition must be real.
實驗結果發表後，有些人開始覺得
人類真的有預知能力

57
00:03:30.561 --> 00:03:34.629
But other people thought, well, if this is
going to be published in one of the top
但是有些人在想既然社會心理學的頂尖期刊
(這篇研究刊登於JPSP)

58
00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.515
journals in our field then maybe we
are not drawing the correct statistical
都接受了，我們卻無法從資料獲得正確的推論
(這篇研究刊登於JPSP)

59
00:03:38.515 --> 00:03:42.110
inferences from data because it
seemed unlikely that this was true.
那可能是這些實驗結果並不是真的
(這篇研究刊登於JPSP)

60
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.350
There has been more criticism
in the scientific literature on
科學文獻裡已經有越來越多批判

61
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.140
how we draw inferences from data.
研究者普遍錯誤地運用資料做推論

62
00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.090
Now, there are some people who
even go as far as to say that most
像這篇論文直接點出大多數發表的研究論文
報告的發現是錯誤的(false)

63
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.110
published research findings are false.
有些學者跳出來說大多數發表的研究論文
報告的發現是錯誤的(false)

64
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.650
Is this true?
真是如此嗎？
(第三章作業將深入認識這篇論文)

65
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:56.720
What do you think?
你怎麼看？
(第三章作業將深入認識這篇論文)

66
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.460
Do you think that most of the scientific
literature is false or not?
你認不認為大部分科學論文的內容都是錯的？
(第三章作業將深入認識這篇論文)

67
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.890
I think the answer is
we don't really know.
我比較接受的答案是「我們不會知道」

68
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.740
We can try to estimate it, but
we don't really have an accurate number.
我們可以評估出錯的狀況，但是永遠得不到
精確的數字

69
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.120
It's more important, probably, to try to
improve the way that we do research to
最重要的是，升級研究的方式可以避免情況惡化

70
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.580
prevent this from continuing on, so that
in the future we know that the data that's
未來進行的研究也能保障分析資料的品質
而能得到正確的結論

71
00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.620
generated and the conclusions that
are drawn are most likely to be correct.
未來進行的研究也能保障分析資料的品質
而能得到正確的結論

72
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.930
There are some problems in
the scientific literature at the moment.
現在的科學論文充斥一些明顯的瑕疵

73
00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.430
We know that many of the sample
sizes we collect are too small, so
像是許多研究的樣本數太小

74
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.850
we have underpowered studies.
導致統計考驗力過低

75
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.570
We know that people are very
flexible in how they analyze data.
還有因為研究者在資料分析過程中保留彈性

76
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.720
So this leads to a lot of flukes,
random findings,
這些彈性造成許多奇異又隨機但是不真實
的結果，卻被拿來當成真實效果

77
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.150
that are actually not true, but
people interpret as a true effect.
這些彈性造成許多奇異又隨機但是不真實
的結果，卻被拿來當成真實效果

78
00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.020
And we know that there is
strong publication bias.
為人所知的問題還有出版偏誤
(publication bias)

79
00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.510
People share findings that show an effect,
but
有的論文報告了顯示明顯效果的發現

80
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.640
they don't share findings
that do not show an effect.
卻不報告沒有明顯效果的發現

81
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.600
And all these things
make it very difficult
這些人為因素都讓評估已發表的研究
可不可信更為困難

82
00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.020
to conclude whether published
findings are reliable or not.
這些人為因素都讓評估已發表的研究
可不可信更為困難

83
00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.000
And the goal in this course is to try to
give you some tools to try this question
這門課程的目標就是讓你學會改善這類問題的工具

84
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.035
better, given that there's publication
bias, flexibility in the data analysis and
特別是由於出版偏誤，資料分析的彈性措施
以及低考驗力的研究，所造成的問題

85
00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:08.099
low-powered studies.
特別是由於出版偏誤，資料分析的彈性措施
以及低考驗力的研究，所造成的問題

86
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.457
So, first of all,
從基本做起

87
00:05:11.457 --> 00:05:15.280
we'll try to make sure that you can
draw better statistical inferences.
接下來的課程先讓你學會比現在更好
的統計推論方法

88
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.450
To achieve this we'll talk about p-values
and how to interpret them, report and
首先我們要談p值的意義，如何在報告
裡運用p值推論(week 1)

89
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.730
calculate effect sizes and confidence
intervals, but also discuss alternative
以及效果量(week 4)與信賴區間(week 5)的計算

90
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.660
ways and frequentist statistics such
as Bayes Factors or likelihoods.
也會介紹次數分配統計學之外的貝式因子
與似然性等等(week 2,6)

91
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.620
The second goal is to enable you to
design more informative experiments.
其次是了解如何設計能帶來充分訊息的實驗

92
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.270
To achieve this, we'll talk about how you
can control error rates when you design
為此，你要學會如何控制研究設計的錯誤率
以及有效執行高考驗力的研究(week 1,3)

93
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.370
studies, how you can efficiently
run high-powered studies.
為此，你要學會如何控制研究設計的錯誤率
以及有效執行高考驗力的研究(week 1,3)

94
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.060
But we'll also focus a little
bit on theory construction.
此外，還要認識一些理論建構的哲學思想
(week 6)

95
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.200
Another goal is to evaluate
the evidence in the literature,
這門課程還談到如何評估科學論文裡的證據

96
00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.350
given that there is publication bias.
特別是存在出版偏誤的情況

97
00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.510
We'll talk about p-curve analysis,
and we'll discuss publication bias and
這部分會介紹P-curve(week 6)以及
辨識出版偏誤的一些方法(week 7)

98
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.750
some ways to identify this in more detail.
這部分會介紹P-curve(week 6)以及
辨識出版偏誤的一些方法(week 7)

99
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.140
Finally, an important goal is to
facilitate cumulative science.
這門課的終極目的是推動有效積累
知識的科學

100
00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.350
Of course,
we try to improve our knowledge.
人的一生都在不斷增進知識

101
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:09.730
How can we do this the best way?
不過我們能不能做得更好

102
00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.300
We'll talk about how you can
perform replication studies,
我們會談到如何進行重製研究(week 7)

103
00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.890
the importance of pre-registration and the
benefits of using pre-registration, and
註冊研究的重要性與好處
(week 3)

104
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.839
the importance of adhering to open
science principles in your research.
遵循開放科學原則進行研究的重要性
(week 7)

105
00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.260
Accompanying these
lectures are assignments,
每一週都有搭配影片講解的練習測驗

106
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.590
and these assignments are really
hands on and in depth knowledge.
這些練習測驗都要深入認識相關知識
才能掌握

107
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.938
The goal is to learn mainly
through simulations.
多數練習是實際進行數據模擬來學習

108
00:06:31.938 --> 00:06:35.780
I'm not a big fan of teaching
through formulas, myself.
我個人並不喜歡在教學中用公式講解
(我也是！)

109
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.940
If you're interested in that,
you can easily look up the literature and
如果你對公式有興趣，可以從各週導讀(overview)

110
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.255
I'll provide references where
these formulas are discussed.
找我推薦閱讀的論文，看更深入的討論

111
00:06:42.255 --> 00:06:46.100
But in these assignments, we'll mainly
rely on performing simulation studies, and
因為這些練習測驗大多數是實做數據模擬  

112
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:49.460
just seeing what happens in
the long run when you would perform
從模擬中觀察連續地(in the long run)
做同一種研究成千上百次，會發生什麼事

113
00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.720
hundreds of thousands of studies.
從模擬中觀察連續地(in the long run)
做同一種研究成千上百次，會發生什麼事

114
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.510
Personally, I've found
that really informative
我的個人經驗是如此學習
能更深刻認識統計學

115
00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.549
when I tried to understand
statistics myself.
我的個人經驗是如此學習
能更深刻認識統計學

116
00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.410
We'll use R, which is free software.
每項練習測驗都會使用免費的R語言

117
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.710
You don't need to have a very good
understanding of how R works.
但你不需要非常了解R也能在測驗裡使用

118
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:09.610
We'll typically use very simple examples
where you can just run the code,
測驗裡的例子都很簡單，
只要你能執行我提供的源碼就行

119
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.803
maybe change one or two numbers.
測驗題只需要你更改源碼中的一兩個數字
(R初學者請從week 1練習作業)

120
00:07:11.803 --> 00:07:15.303
That's really all you need
to know about how R works.
你只要知道如何執行R的源碼就行
