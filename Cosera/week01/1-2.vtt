[什麼是p值]  
  
2  
00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:12.311  
If you read articles in  
the scientific literature,  
你一定常在閱讀科學文獻時  
  
3  
00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:17.405  
you'll often see people report P-values  
when they report statistical tests.  
發現統計檢定報告裡有很多p值(p-values)  
  
4  
00:00:17.405 --> 00:00:21.660  
P-values are widely used, and it's  
important to understand what they mean.  
p值被廣泛使用，當然要了解其意義  
  
5  
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.290  
They're also widely criticized, because  
people often misinterpret p-values.  
p值也倍受批評，因為常有錯誤的推論  
  
6  
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.430  
So in this lecture, the goal is  
to understand what they mean and  
這節課程要理解p值所指為何  
  
7  
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.830  
how to correctly interpret them.  
以及正確運用p值推論  
  
8  
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.120  
When we talk about p-values, the first  
question we should ask ourselves is  
談到p值，首先要問的問題是  
  
9  
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.610  
why are they so  
popular in scientific articles?  
為什麼許多科學文獻都會看到p值？  
  
10  
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.060  
Well, there's a reason for this, and  
Benjamini expresses it quite nicely.  
以色列統計學者Yoav Benjamini有很好的回答  
  
11  
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.000  
He says in some sense it offers  
a first line of defense against  
他說「起碼來說，p值是避免我們被隨機現象  
  
12  
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.030  
being fooled by randomness,  
separating the signal from the noise.  
愚弄的第一道防線，也就是從噪音裡區辨信號」  
  
13  
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.670  
So, this is what the p-values  
allow you to do.  
這是p值的基本功能  
  
14  
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.550  
When you interpret your data,  
你對資料進行推論時  
  
15  
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.780  
you might be very likely to interpret data  
in favor of the hypothesis that you have,  
應該很期待資料支持你的假設  
  
16  
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.210  
even when the effect might be only  
slightly in the right direction.  
即使期待的方向只有一點點效果  
  
17  
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.120  
The risk is that you're fooling yourself.  
冒下結論的後果可能是愚弄自已  
  
18  
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.830  
You might be too likely to declare  
that something is going on,  
特別是從只存在隨機變異的資料裡  
  
19  
00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.080  
when you're actually looking  
at random variation in data.  
宣稱出現有意義的訊息  
  
20  
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.315  
So, p-values are one way to  
prevent you from fooling yourself.  
因此p值是避免自已做傻事的一種設計  
  
21  
00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:29.195  
P-values tell you how surprising the data  
is, assuming that there is no effect.  
p值是在假設不存在效果的前提下，  
告訴你資料之中有沒有驚喜(存在效果)  
  
22  
00:01:29.195 --> 00:01:32.450  
And we'll look at all these  
aspects in more detail.  
接下來要解釋這句話的意思  
  
23  
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.350  
What surprising means,  
why they're statements about the data, and  
驚喜是指什麼？  
為什麼p值能代表資料的狀態？  
  
24  
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.719  
why they're built on the idea  
that there is no effect.  
為什麼要先假定不存在任何效果？  
  
25  
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.630  
Now, some people say  
that p-values are more  
有些人會說p值是你了解貝式統計前  
能正確解釋資料的工具  
  
26  
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.255  
accurately explained as what you use if  
you don't know Bayesian statistics yet.  
有些人會說p值是你了解貝式統計前  
能正確解釋資料的工具  
  
27  
00:01:48.255 --> 00:01:52.810  
In Bayesian statistics,  
people don't use p-values.  
使用貝式統計的人不使用p值推論  
  
28  
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.670  
And I still remember when I  
was doing my own PhD, that I  
我還記得當我還在唸博士班時  
  
29  
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.010  
had this confusion about whether I should  
use p-values, or Bayesian statistics.  
被到底該用p值還是貝氏統計所困擾  
  
30  
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.070  
My understanding was, more or less,  
that I realized there was some problem  
當時的我或多或少以為，有些問題用p值較好  
有些用貝氏統計較合適  
  
31  
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.040  
with using p-values, and Bayesian  
statistics might be preferable, but  
當時的我或多或少以為，有些問題用p值較好  
有些用貝氏統計較合適  
  
32  
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.310  
most people didn't use  
Bayesian statistics.  
但是當時很少人使用貝氏統計  
  
33  
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.430  
So, it was probably fine to  
just continue using p-values.  
所以那時就跟著一起用p值做統計推論  
  
34  
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.150  
Now, I think it's fine to use p-values,  
but you should interpret them correctly.  
現在的我認為只要推論方法正確  
p值還是很好用的  
  
35  
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.430  
So, that's the goal in this lecture,  
to prevent this confusion in you,  
所以這一講的目標就是掃除你的困擾  
  
36  
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.270  
and to make sure that you use p-values  
correctly, if you decide to use them.  
決定使用p值時，能正確使用p值推論  
  
37  
00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.850  
Let's start with a practical example.  
用這個實際的例子來說明  
  
38  
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.420  
Let's say you want to to do a study where  
you examine the influence of calling  
比方說你要研究開車時講電話的影響  
  
39  
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:39.545  
while you are driving.  
比方說你要研究開車時講電話的影響  
  
40  
00:02:39.545 --> 00:02:43.620  
Does being on the phone when you  
are in your car increase the risk of  
開車時講電話會增加出車禍的風險嗎？  
  
41  
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.530  
getting into an accident?  
開車時講電話會增加出車禍的風險嗎？  
  
42  
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.090  
You might design a study where half of  
the participants drive around the city  
也許你會設計一個研究讓半數參與者在市區開車時  
講電話，另一半開車時不講電話  
  
43  
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.120  
while they're on the phone, and the other  
half of the participants drive around, but  
也許你會設計一個研究讓半數參與者在市區開車時  
講電話，另一半開車時不講電話  
  
44  
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.820  
they're not on the phone.  
也許你會設計一個研究讓半數參與者在市區開車時  
講電話，另一半開車時不講電話  
  
45  
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.570  
You want to see if there's a difference,  
你會想看到一些組間差異  
  
46  
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.810  
maybe in the number of people they hit  
while they're driving through the street.  
像是一趟下來開車撞人的次數  
  
47  
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.610  
Or maybe your ethical committee  
doesn't allow you to do this,  
不過倫理審查委員會大概不允許這麼做  
  
48  
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.299  
and you're better off using  
a driving simulator to study this.  
所以最好用駕駛模擬器來做研究  
  
49  
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.530  
Now, if you have collected your data, you  
counted how many people get hit by a car,  
假想你已收完資料，要清點每位講電話的駕駛  
與沒講電話的駕駛撞到的人數  
  
50  
00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:18.250  
either by people who are on  
the phone while they're driving or  
假想你已收完資料，要清點每位講電話的駕駛  
與沒講電話的駕駛撞到的人數  
  
51  
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.310  
people who are not on the phone,  
假想你已收完資料，要清點每位講電話的駕駛  
與沒講電話的駕駛撞到的人數  
  
52  
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.300  
then you can look at the difference  
between these two conditions.  
然後檢查這兩組駕駛之間的表現差異  
  
53  
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.420  
Now, this difference  
is never exactly zero.  
兩組的表現差異永遠不會剛好等於零  
  
54  
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.140  
There's always some number follow after  
the comma that makes a difference.  
小數點之後總是有除不盡的數字  
  
55  
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.290  
So, let's say the difference you  
observe is 0.11, a mean difference.  
假定你收集到的資料，兩組平均差異是0.11  
  
56  
00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.010  
Now, how should you interpret  
this mean difference?  
你要如何解釋這樣的差異  
  
57  
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.980  
There are two options.  
你有兩種選擇  
  
58  
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.995  
A, what you are looking at is  
probably just random noise.  
選擇A，這個數值純粹是隨機變異  
  
59  
00:03:46.995 --> 00:03:49.760  
There's always some random  
noise in your data.  
因為研究資料中總是存在隨機變異  
  
60  
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.850  
Option B, this is probably a real  
difference, this is something that  
選擇B，可能真的有差異  
  
61  
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.070  
you should take seriously, and at least  
examine further in future studies.  
不過要小心，並要在之後的研究再做檢驗  
  
62  
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.050  
So, which of these two is true.  
到底那個選擇才正確？  
  
63  
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.769  
Well, we can use the p-value to  
differentiate between these two options.  
我們可以用p值評估兩種選擇的差異  
  
64  
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.370  
From the data that we have, we can  
calculate means, standard deviations, and  
我們可以用手上資料計算平均值，標準差  
還有樣本數  
  
65  
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.740  
we know the sample size that we have.  
我們可以用手上資料計算平均值，標準差  
還有樣本數  
  
66  
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.010  
We can use these parameters to  
calculate a test statistic, and  
我們可以使用這些參數(parameters)計算統計值  
  
67  
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.260  
compare this test statistic  
against a distribution.  
統計值能拿來與機率分配(distribution)做比較  
  
68  
00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.350  
You can use many different  
types of distributions.  
能用的機率分配(distribution)相當多種  
  
69  
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.430  
If you examine precognition, you might  
want to use a paranormal distribution.  
像是要檢驗預知能力，也許需要超常分配  
(請介紹給前台大校長李教授)  
  
70  
00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.300  
But most often,  
people just use the normal distribution.  
不過大部分情況，我們只需要常態分配  
  
71  
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.360  
So, this bell shaped graph is  
something you might have seen before.  
你可能曾在其它地方看過這樣的鐘型曲線  
  
72  
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.130  
And there's something you  
should note here, and  
要特別注意的地方是  
  
73  
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.710  
that's that this distribution  
is centered on zero.  
常態分配的中心位於0  
  
74  
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.930  
And when we talk about the p-value  
being data that is surprising,  
我們說如果p值顯示資料之中有驚奇  
  
75  
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:54.120  
assuming the null is true, the null  
hypothesis is true, this is what we mean.  
是建立虛無假設為真的前提，就是指中心位於0  
的常態分配  
  
76  
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.150  
We look at a distribution  
centered at zero.  
是建立虛無假設為真的前提，就是指中心位於0  
的常態分配  
  
77  
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.950  
Now, you can see that most of  
the data in this case, let's look  
如果虛無假設的確為真，就有95%的資料  
屬於圖中的著色區域  
  
78  
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.220  
at 95% of the data,  
will fall between two critical values.  
也就是剛好落於兩個臨界值之間  
  
79  
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.144  
And these critical values, you might  
have seen this number, 1.96 and -1.96.  
圖中可以看到這兩個臨界值1.96 與 -1.96  
  
80  
00:05:13.144 --> 00:05:17.930  
These are critical values if you  
want to use an alpha level of 0.05.  
若你設定顯著水準為0.05，會得到這兩個臨界值  
  
81  
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.060  
If data falls between these two values,  
it's not surprising.  
如果由資料算出來的統計值落在兩個臨界值之間  
就沒有驚奇  
  
82  
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.450  
Assuming that the null hypothesis is true,  
再講一次，假設虛無假設確實為值  
  
83  
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.829  
most of the data will fall between  
these two critical values.  
多數資料算出來的統計值落在兩個臨界值之間  
  
84  
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:35.020  
But sometimes, we might see a data  
point that's more extreme than this.  
不過有時資料會落到臨界值之外  
  
85  
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.250  
And this is a surprising find.  
這就是出現驚喜的情況  
  
86  
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.080  
This is surprising data whenever the mean  
difference, or the test statistic that is  
從平均值差異計算的統計值，只要落在任何一邊  
的臨界值之外，就代表資料之中有驚喜  
  
87  
00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.420  
computed from this mean difference, is in  
one of the two tails of this distribution.  
從平均值差異計算的統計值，只要落在任何一側  
的臨界值之外，就代表資料之中有驚喜  
  
88  
00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.150  
So, whenever we find that data that  
falls in these tails, it's surprising.  
只要我們發現資料出現在任一側  
就代表出現驚喜  
  
89  
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.220  
And we might want to examine it further.  
再進一步檢查的話，會發現對應的p值小於0.05  
  
90  
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.030  
It also means that the p-value's  
smaller than 0.05.  
再進一步檢查的話，會發現對應的p值小於0.05  
  
91  
00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:03.960  
The formal definition of a p-value is  
the probability of getting the observed,  
p值的正式定義是，在虛無假設為真的前提下  
觀察值或「極端資料」屬於此分配的機率  
  
92  
00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.920  
or more extreme data,  
assuming the null hypothesis is true.  
p值的正式定義是，在虛無假設為真的前提下  
觀察值或「極端資料」屬於此分配的機率  
  
93  
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.920  
Now, I highlighted the word data here.  
我特別把「資料」標示出來  
  
94  
00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.560  
I think it's important to realize that  
we're talking about the probability of  
是提醒大家，p值代表觀察到這項資料的「機率」  
  
95  
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.440  
observing data.  
是提醒大家，p值代表觀察到這項資料的「機率」  
  
96  
00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.670  
A p-value is the probability  
that you'll observe some data,  
p值是你會觀察到這項資料的機率  
P(Data|Theory)  
  
97  
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.610  
but not the probability of a theory.  
不是你的理論為真的機率  
P(Theory)  
  
98  
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.170  
This is a very common misunderstanding.  
後一句話是常見的誤解  
  
99  
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.980  
People often want to make a statement  
about the probability that  
許多人想用理論為真的機率支持自已的主張  
  
100  
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:30.530  
the theory is true.  
許多人想用理論為真的機率支持自已的主張  
  
101  
00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:31.990  
But when you calculate a p-value,  
但是你算出p值後，能主張的只是  
獲得這項資料的機率  
  
102  
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.510  
all you can do is make a statement  
about the probability of the data.  
但是你算出p值後，能主張的只是  
獲得這項資料的機率  
  
103  
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.640  
Now, if you make this mistake,  
you're in good company.  
如果現在的你也有同樣的誤解  
那你並不孤單  
  
104  
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.160  
Let's take a look at this example from  
quantum physics, where a physicist talks  
來看看量子力學的實際例子，物理學家想知道  
觀察到不同地點的粒子同時自旋機率  
  
105  
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:49.180  
about the probability of observing  
a certain spin between quantum particles.  
來看看量子力學的實際例子，物理學家想知道  
觀察到不同地點的粒子同時自旋機率  
  
106  
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.320  
So, this is a study where they  
measured the spin in a particle levels  
發表這篇論文的物理學家，有些人在台夫特(Delft)  
  
107  
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:56.460  
floating around somewhere in Delft,  
and another one that was floating  
測量粒子自旋，同時另一批人在阿姆斯特丹  
  
108  
00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.430  
around somewhere in Amsterdam,  
in the Netherlands, and  
對另一顆粒子進行相同的測量  
  
109  
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:03.780  
these two particles spin together,  
they have some sort of relationship.  
他們想從測量的結果，推論兩顆同時自旋的粒子  
  
110  
00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.990  
And this relationship, based on the data,  
彼此之間存在什麼關係  
  
111  
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:10.334  
was statistically significant  
with a p-value of 0.04.  
因為他們得到p值為0.04的統計顯著結果  
  
112  
00:07:11.896 --> 00:07:16.080  
Now, some physicist is interviewed  
about this finding, and this physicist  
其中某位物理學家接受訪問談他們的發現  
  
113  
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.910  
concludes, in other words, there is  
a 96% probability they won the race.  
這位學者以統計結果宣稱有96%的機率，  
他們的理論正確預測這兩顆粒子的關係  
  
114  
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:27.700  
So, this person is making a mistake  
here because, with won the race,  
這樣的宣稱其實是錯誤的  
  
115  
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.980  
this person means there's a 96%  
probability that this theory is correct.  
96%的機率在理論上是正確的  
  
116  
00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.910  
But this is a statement about a theory.  
但是這只是基於理論做出的結論  
  
117  
00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.890  
It's not a statement about  
the data that you have observed.  
並不是基於觀察到的資料做出結論  
  
118  
00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.812  
So it's comforting, maybe,  
that a quantum physicist,  
聽完這例子你應該感到很欣慰  
  
119  
00:07:40.812 --> 00:07:43.616  
which sounds like you're  
supposed to be really smart,  
量子物理學家應該比一般人聰明  
  
120  
00:07:43.616 --> 00:07:46.737  
also makes this misinterpretation  
of what a p-value means.  
也會搞錯p值的真正意義  
  
121  
00:07:48.258 --> 00:07:53.408  
After you have observed a p-value  
that's smaller than 0.05,  
如果說你分析今天收完的資料確實發現  
小於0.05的p值  
  
122  
00:07:53.408 --> 00:07:57.669  
for example,  
an effect is not 95% likely to be true.  
也不能說你發現的效果有95%的機率是真的  
  
123  
00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:00.348    
Think about pre-cognition research.    
拿超感知覺(pre-cognition)的案例來說    
(Bem, 2011. JPSP)    
  
124  
00:08:00.348 --> 00:08:03.330    
Let's say that I present    
one study to you where you    
你讀到其中一項實驗報告  
  
125  
00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.120  
find a statistically significant  
effect of pre-cognition.    
超常知覺的實驗效果有統計顯著    
  
126  
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:13.860  
After this, do you really think it's now  
95% probable that pre-cognition exists?  
你能相信有95%的機率超感知覺確實存在？  
  
127  
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:19.160  
Probably not,  
you cannot get the probability  
你應該不相信  
你不可能把p值當成根據現在結果  
  
128  
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.512  
that the null hypothesis is true,  
given the data from a p-value.  
支持(虛無)假設為真的真實機率  
  
129  
00:08:24.512 --> 00:08:29.860  
If you look at the two statements below on  
the screen, you see that the probability  
仔細看這張投影片最下面的不等式  
  
130  
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:35.240  
of the data, or more extreme data,  
assuming the null hypothesis is true.  
左邊是(虛無)假設為真，  
獲得超出臨界值資料的條件機率  
  
131  
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.090  
It's not the same as  
the probability of an hypothesis  
右邊是現在獲得的資料，  
能證實假設為真的條件機率  
  
132  
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:41.680  
given some data that you have observed.  
右邊是現在獲得的資料，  
能證實假設為真的條件機率  
  
133  
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.558  
This two probabilities can differ widely.  
兩個條件機率不能彼此互換  
  
134  
00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:49.127  
If you want to know the probability  
that the theory is true,  
想知道理論為真的機率，必須使用貝式統計    
  
135  
00:08:49.127 --> 00:08:51.770  
you need to use Bayesian statistics.  
想知道理論為真的機率，必須使用貝式統計    
  
136  
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:56.144  
Bayesian statistics is the only  
approach that will allow you to make  
貝式統計是唯一能計算理論為真之機率的方法    
  
137  
00:08:56.144 --> 00:08:59.988  
statements about the probability  
that the theory is true.  
貝式統計是唯一能計算理論為真之機率的方法    
  
138  
00:08:59.988 --> 00:09:06.004  
What happens if you do a study and  
your p-value is larger than 0.05?  
當你的研究得到大於0.05的p值該怎麼辦？    
  
139  
00:09:06.004 --> 00:09:10.332  
Well first of course, you spend a lot of  
time and effort collecting this data, and  
也許你首先想到自已花了這麼久時間收集資料    
  
140  
00:09:10.332 --> 00:09:14.070  
maybe you hope to find  
the statistically significant effect.  
滿心期待能獲得顯著的統計效果    
  
141  
00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.120  
So the first thing you do is cry a little,  
you're a little bit depressed.  
看到不顯著的結果會想先躲起來哭哭    
  
142  
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.530  
That's okay, But after this how  
should you interpret this data?  
療愈完畢還要面對如何用這份資料做推論？  
  
143  
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:24.875  
Well, all that we know when  
the p-value is larger than  
再次提醒大於0.05的p值  
代表的只是這次觀察的結果沒有驚喜  
  
144  
00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:29.500  
0.05 is that the data we have observed  
is not surprising, that's all.    
再次提醒大於0.05的p值    
代表的只是這次觀察的結果沒有驚喜    
  
145  
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:34.810    
It doesn't mean that    
there is no true effect.    
不顯著不是不存在真實效果    
    
146  
00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:36.970    
There might very well be in effect but    
只是剛好參與你的研究的參與者人數不多  
所以無法偵測到這個效果    
   
147  
00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:42.080  
you just didn't have enough participants  
in your study to detect this effect.  
只是剛好參與你的研究的參與者人數不多  
所以無法偵測到這個效果    
    
148  
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:48.350    
Remember that you need large samples    
to statistically detect a small effect.    
隨時記得小效果需要大樣本才能達到統計顯著    
  
149  
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.440  
So just because your  
p-value is larger than 0.05  
不要因為p值大於0.05就妄下沒有效果的結論    
(中研院前院長翁啟惠很了解這點)    
  
150  
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.360  
doesn't allow you to conclude  
that there is no effect.  
不要因為p值大於0.05就妄下沒有效果的結論    
(中研院前院長翁啟惠很了解這點)    
  
151  
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.150  
There might be very small effect,  
you don't know.  
你並不清楚有沒有存在相當微小的效果    
  
152  
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:04.160  
Personally, I try to think of  
a p-value larger than 0.05 as mu,  
我個人喜歡把大於0.05的p值當成「無」    
(外國人發音類似mu，希臘字母μ)    
  
153  
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.830  
which is a concept from Zen Buddhism.  
這是源自禪宗的概念    
  
154  
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:12.020  
In Zen Buddhism, there is a famous  
saying that goes like this.  
中國唐代趙州從諗禪師留下這一則公案  
(狗子佛性)    
  
155  
00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:18.140  
A monk asked a Chinese Zen master,  
does a dog have a Buddha-nature or not?  
有僧人問禪師「狗子有佛性乎？」  
  
156  
00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:19.630  
So you might expect a yes or  
由你來答的話，也許會想這是個是非題    
不是有就是沒有    
  
157  
00:10:19.630 --> 00:10:24.500  
no answer here because that's also how  
the question is phrased yes or no.  
由你來答的話，也許會想這是個是非題    
不是有就是沒有    
  
158  
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.670  
But instead the Zen master answered mu,  
which basically means I'm on  
不過禪師會根據問者的角度回答    
  
159  
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.940  
asking the question it's negating  
the question that's asked.  
這則公案點出這種問題沒有是非對錯    
    
160  
00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.432  
Whenever you find a p-value  
that's larger than 0.05,  
回頭看你發現自已的結果p值大於0.05    
  
161  
00:10:37.432 --> 00:10:41.600  
you might feel the tendency to say so  
is there an effect or not?  
你本來有一股勁要說「真的存在這個效果」    
  
162  
00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.490  
But whenever the p-value is larger than  
0.05, you can't answer this question.  
大於0.05的p值卻讓你說不出口    
  
163  
00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:51.230  
So you should just answer mu.  
所以最好的答案應該是「無(這種問題)」    
  
164  
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.300    
So how do you use p-values correctly?    
那麼要如何正確使用p值推論？  
  
165  
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:58.060  
The first thing to understand  
is that p-values can be use  
要先了解p值是提供研究者  
長期行動準則  
  
166  
00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.010  
as a rule to guide  
behavior in the long run.  
要先了解p值是提供研究者  
長期行動準則  
  
167  
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:07.310  
You can calculate them for every single  
study, but they only work in the long run.  
每次研究都可以得到一個p值  
但是要長期累積才能顯出意義  
  
168  
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.920  
Let's take a look how.  
我們來看怎麼回事  
  
169  
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.960  
If you use the decision rule whenever the  
p-value is smaller than the alpha level,  
只要你採取判斷p值是否小於顯著水準的規則  
  
170  
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:19.597  
so this is your type one error rate,  
which is often set to 0.05,  
就會得到型一錯誤率，通常我們設定為0.05  
  
171  
00:11:19.597 --> 00:11:24.350  
you can act as if the data is not noise.  
這條規則說  
「如果資料並非雜訊，你就能採取行動」  
  
172  
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.440  
Now this word act is very important.  
「採取行動」的真正意義很重要  
  
173  
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:32.050  
It's independent of what you believe is  
true, but all that you know is, if you use  
這無關你相信什麼是真的，當你使用這規則  
推論數萬筆沒有訊息的資料，除了其中5%  
  
174  
00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:36.880  
this decision rule in the long run,  
you won't say that there is something,  
這無關你相信什麼是真的，當你使用這規則  
推論數萬筆沒有訊息的資料，除了其中5%  
  
175  
00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.566  
when there is nothing,  
more than 5% of the time.  
你都會宣稱沒有任何訊息  
  
176  
00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:47.420  
Alternatively, when the p-value is larger  
than the alpha you can remain uncertain or  
另一條規則說「得到大於顯著水準的p值，  
  
177  
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.620  
act as if the data is just noise.  
你可以保持不確定或視資料是一堆雜訊」  
  
178  
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:54.050  
So these are rules that you  
follow in the long run.  
以上就是你的長期行動準則  
  
179  
00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:59.360  
When you act as if there is an effect  
whenever the p-value is smaller than 0.05,  
以小於0.05的p值宣稱存在一種效果，  
你做上萬次資料分析出錯機率不會超過5%  
  
180  
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:06.910  
in the long run you won't be  
wrong more than 5% of the time.  
以小於0.05的p值宣稱存在一種效果，  
你做上萬次資料分析出錯機率不會超過5%  
  
181  
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:12.340  
Now this is an interpretation of p-values  
as proposed by name and it's often used.  
p值的推論模式正如其名，  
而且用途很廣泛  
  
182  
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:16.440  
Let's take the discovery of  
the Higgs boson as an example.  
來看看宣稱發現希格斯玻色子的報告  
  
183  
00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.522  
If you're a remember, during the press  
conference about the Higgs boson,  
請找一下宣佈這項發現的新聞  
(CERN, 2012/06/22)  
  
184  
00:12:20.522 --> 00:12:25.170  
researchers were talking about whether  
the 5 sigma threshold was passed.  
研究人員提到實驗結果超過5個標準差  
  
185  
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:31.320  
And 5 sigma is used as a threshold to  
declare something a discovery in physics.  
物理學裡定義5個標準差  
是確定事實存在的標準  
  
186  
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:38.670  
Now 5 sigma is basically  
a p-value smaller than 0.0000003.  
換算成p值是小於0.0000003  
  
187  
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:44.110  
So based on this idea,  
we can act as if the Higgs boson is true.  
根據規則，我們可以當希格斯玻色子存在  
而採取行動(CERN發佈新聞)  
  
188  
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:46.040  
Every now and  
即使是如此高的標準，說不定那一天  
我們會發現這個結論是錯誤的  
  
189  
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:50.650  
then of course we'll be wrong with  
such a high threshold for an error.  
即使是如此高的標準，說不定那一天  
我們會發現這個結論是錯誤的  
  
190  
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:55.310  
We'll only be wrong in one of many  
billions of parallel universes.  
如果有上萬個平行宇宙  
只有其中一個會確認這發現是錯的  
  
191  
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:59.050  
So there's one parallel universe  
where people spend the time and  
想像在上萬個平行宇宙裡  
  
192  
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:03.640  
effort to build a large Hadron Collider  
to detect the Higgs boson and  
都有建造偵測希格斯玻色子的大型強子對撞機  
  
  
193  
00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.970  
they declared it was  
a statistically significance.  
而且都發現統計顯著的結果  
  
194  
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:09.430  
So it was they were actually wrong but  
根據如此高的標準，所有平行宇宙發現都是錯  
的機率是相當微小  
  
195  
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:12.490  
with such a high threshold this  
of course rarely happens and  
根據如此高的標準，所有平行宇宙發現都是錯  
的機率是相當微小  
  
196  
00:13:12.490 --> 00:13:16.240  
we can be pretty safe that there is a  
Higgs boson and we didn't make a mistake.  
所以我們可以確信希格斯玻色子真的存在  
而且相信不會發現任何反證  
  
197  
00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:23.695  
When you interpret p-values and  
you want to write something about what you  
在報告中如此寫下對p值的推論是錯的：  
「因為p值小於.05，我們的理論獲得證實」  
  
198  
00:13:23.695 --> 00:13:29.740  
found you should not write, we found a  
p-value smaller than 0.05, so our theory.  
在報告中如此寫下對p值的推論是錯的：  
「因為p值小於.05，我們的理論獲得證實」  
  
199  
00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:34.559  
Because if you do this, you're  
making a statement about this theory  
這麼做是依據p值做出對理論的陳述  
稍早(8分24秒)已說明這是錯的  
  
200  
00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:37.891  
based on a p-value and  
you shouldn't do this.  
這麼做是依據p值做出對理論的陳述  
稍早(8分24秒)已說明這是錯的  
  
201  
00:13:37.891 --> 00:13:42.493  
The correct way to discuss a p-value  
smaller than 0.05 is to say we  
正確的報告應該這樣寫：  
「因為p值小於.05，我們的資料符合預期」  
  
202  
00:13:42.493 --> 00:13:46.242  
found the p-value smaller than 0.05,  
so our data.  
正確的報告應該這樣寫：  
「因為p值小於.05，我們的資料符合預期」  
  
203  
00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:50.974  
You make a statement about the data  
because that's what the p-value  
這樣的報告是根據p值陳述資料的狀況  
  
204  
00:13:50.974 --> 00:13:52.310  
relates to.  
這樣的報告是根據p值陳述資料的狀況  
  
205  
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:53.940  
You might say something like, so  
接著才能加些說明  
  
206  
00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:58.280  
our data is in line with some  
idea that you want to test.  
像是資料與要測試的理論預測一致  
  
207  
00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:06.840  
Whenever you found a known significant  
result, a p-value larger than 0.05.  
要是你做的研究p值大於0.05，是曾經有人  
發現顯著統計結果的研究  
  
208  
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.680  
You enter what's known as  
a degenerative research line.  
那你就是遇上了「退化性研究進程」  
(degenerative research line:參考Imre Laktos)  
  
209  
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.350  
You made a prediction but  
it doesn't hold up.  
事前有預測卻沒有符合的發現  
  
210  
00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:16.020  
So you have something to explain.  
必須要花更多功夫解釋  
  
211  
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.045  
Now one explanation might  
just be random variation.  
其中一種解釋是隨機變異  
  
212  
00:14:19.045 --> 00:14:23.810  
P-values vary and even if you have  
examined a true effect, every now and  
即使你檢視的是真實效果，p值變異有可能  
導致你某次的研究出現不顯著的結果  
  
213  
00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:26.660  
then you'll observe  
a non-significant result.  
即使你檢視的是真實效果，p值變異有可能  
導致你某次的研究出現不顯著的結果  
  
214  
00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.120  
So you might just say,  
everything's fine, this happens.  
第一次你也許會想「沒關係，剛好而己」  
  
215  
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.650  
If I do another study that's exactly the  
same, you'll see that it will pan out and  
若是再作一次還是不顯著，你也許會想  
「總會做出來的，理論應該沒問題」  
  
216  
00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.550  
my prediction will hold.  
若是再作一次還是不顯著，你也許會想  
「總會做出來的，理論應該沒問題」  
  
217  
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:37.930  
Other times, you might need to say,  
但是第三次還是不顯著，也許會開始想  
  
218  
00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:41.950  
well the effect that I predicted  
might be smaller than I expected.  
「實際的效果可能比我預期效果還小」  
  
219  
00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:44.070  
So you do another study,  
but it's larger and  
抱著這樣心態做最後一次，  
搞不好發現了更大的效果  
  
220  
00:14:44.070 --> 00:14:45.960  
then you show that  
the effect is really there.  
這時總算可以宣佈確實有效果  
  
221  
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.790  
Nevertheless, whenever you  
find a non-significant result,  
無論如何，一旦遇上了不顯著結果  
  
222  
00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.010  
there is something to think about.  
必有一些事情要好好考慮  
  
223  
00:14:53.010 --> 00:14:54.980  
You have to explain it in some way.  
你必須採取某種解釋方法  
  
224  
00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.480  
One way might be, if you do a lot of  
studies, every now and then you will find  
一種方法是持續累積大量不顯著的結果  
但是需要進行相當多次才能支持你的看法  
  
225  
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.130  
a non significant result, but then you  
need a lot of studies to support this.  
一種方法是持續累積大量不顯著的結果  
但是需要進行相當多次才能支持你的看法  
  
226  
00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:06.950  
Other times you might say, I have to do  
the study in a slightly different way, and  
還有一種方法是改變一下研究設計  
  
227  
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.658  
you can use this change in the paradigm  
to develop a progressive research line.  
因此而讓研究方法更容易偵測效果，就會促成  
「進步性研究進程」(progressive research line)  
  
228  
00:15:11.658 --> 00:15:14.683  
Remember that p-values vary so  
要做到如此，必須記得  
要以整合分析的角度思考每個p值的意義  
  
229  
00:15:14.683 --> 00:15:19.740  
always think meta-analytically  
about p-values.  
要做到如此，必須記得  
要以整合分析的角度思考每個p值的意義  
  
230  
00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.980  
This is also recommended by the  
statisticians who talked about p-values in  
開發p值運用方法的元祖統計學家也這樣建議  
  
231  
00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.280  
the very beginning.  
開發p值運用方法的元祖統計學家也這樣建議  
  
232  
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.080  
For example,  
this is a quote by Neyman and Pearson.  
就像這摘自尼曼與皮爾森(1928)論文的一段話  
  
233  
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.850  
Statistical tests should  
be used with discretion and  
「統計檢定必須在有洞見與認識的狀況下使用，  
而非被當作試誤的工具」  
  
234  
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:37.780  
understanding, and not as instruments  
which themselves give the final verdict.  
「統計檢定必須在有洞見與認識的狀況下使用，  
而非被當作試誤的工具」  
  
235  
00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.070  
So if you fail a statistical  
test that's only one thing  
如果資料無法通過計檢定  
  
236  
00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:45.412  
that should go into your reasoning to  
decide whether this is a true effect.  
要做的是反省判斷真實效果的推理過程  
  
237  
00:15:45.412 --> 00:15:48.601  
Always think more about your study.  
永遠要先考慮自已的研究條件  
  
238  
00:15:48.601 --> 00:15:53.358  
P-value might be a starting points, but  
you also want to look at effect sizes and  
p值不過是分析的開始，也要檢視效果量  
  
239  
00:15:53.358 --> 00:15:55.490  
other studies that have been done.  
還要參考曾在相同條件做過的研究  
  
240  
00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:59.677  
Fisher similarly says  
that a single p-value was  
費雪(1937)也有類似的看法  
  
241  
00:15:59.677 --> 00:16:03.259  
not enough to declare some discovery on.  
主張一個p值不足以宣稱「真正發現某物」  
  
242  
00:16:03.259 --> 00:16:08.197  
He says, a phenomenon is experimentally  
demonstrable when we know how  
他說「能透過實驗呈現的現象，  
是因為這項實驗極少出現  
  
243  
00:16:08.197 --> 00:16:11.982  
to conduct an experiment which  
will rarely fail to give  
他說「能透過實驗呈現的現象，  
是因為這項實驗極少出現  
  
244  
00:16:11.982 --> 00:16:14.881  
us a statistically significant result.  
不顯著的統計結果」  
  
245  
00:16:14.881 --> 00:16:18.364  
So we have to repeat  
the experiment multiple times.  
這也是為什麼必須多次重覆相同實驗  
  
246  
00:16:18.364 --> 00:16:23.738  
He also says, no isolated experiment,  
however significant in itself,  
費雪還說「就算單一實驗結果是顯著的，  
也不能代表這項結果呈現任何自然現象」  
  
247  
00:16:23.738 --> 00:16:29.382  
can suffice for the experimental  
demonstration of any natural phenomenon.  
費雪還說「就算單一實驗結果是顯著的，  
也不能代表這項結果呈現任何自然現象」  
  
248  
00:16:29.382 --> 00:16:32.874  
So he's saying that we  
should see a single p-value,  
他主張單一p值是提示有更多值得  
探索的事實  
  
249  
00:16:32.874 --> 00:16:36.756  
maybe as an invitation to  
explore this effect further, but  
他主張單一p值是提示有更多值得  
探索的事實  
  
250  
00:16:36.756 --> 00:16:40.887  
it can never be enough to declare  
something a scientific fact.  
並不能用來宣稱發現某項科學事實  
  
251  
00:16:40.887 --> 00:16:43.267  
So we always need to  
do several studies and  
我們必須儘可能多做重覆研究  
  
252  
00:16:43.267 --> 00:16:47.424  
p-values can guide us in the long run  
in which studies we might want to do.  
運用p值在過程中改進研究條件  
  
253  
00:16:49.537 --> 00:16:51.445  
So, at the end of this lecture,  
終於來到這一講的尾聲  
  
254  
00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:56.340  
let's take a look at the p-values that you  
can expect when there is a true effect.  
假想要從這一堆p值找出預期的真實效果  
  
255  
00:16:56.340 --> 00:17:00.554  
And the p-values that you might  
expect when there is no true effect.  
以及從另一堆p值確定不存在真實效果  
  
256  
00:17:00.554 --> 00:17:05.375  
Now, I never really realized how  
p-values are distributed across studies  
只是沒人知道這些來自不同研究的p值  
形成什麼的分配？  
  
257  
00:17:05.375 --> 00:17:06.963  
when you do a lot of them.  
只是沒人知道這些來自不同研究的p值  
形成什麼的分配？  
  
258  
00:17:06.963 --> 00:17:09.590  
And I think it's very important  
to understand this for  
如何正確推論p值的意義是這一講的重點  
  
259  
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:11.712  
the correct interpretation of a p-value.  
如何正確推論p值的意義是這一講的重點  
  
260  
00:17:11.712 --> 00:17:13.755  
So take a moment to think about this.  
現在請你花點時間想想  
  
261  
00:17:13.755 --> 00:17:17.749  
What kind of p-values would you  
expect when there is a true effect?  
你會期待從什麼樣的p值發現真實效果？  
  
262  
00:17:17.749 --> 00:17:22.637  
What kind of p-values would you  
expect when there is no effect?  
還有從什麼樣的p值發現不存在真實效果？  
  
263  
00:17:22.637 --> 00:17:25.539  
Let's take a look what really happens.  
現在來看看正確答案  
  
264  
00:17:25.539 --> 00:17:27.580  
When there is a true effect,  
存在真實效果時，p值的分配形態  
決定於統計考驗力  
  
265  
00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:32.099  
the p-value distribution depends  
on the statistical power.  
存在真實效果時，p值的分配形態  
決定於統計考驗力  
  
266  
00:17:32.099 --> 00:17:35.129  
Let's take a look at  
the visualization of this.  
來看看模擬結果的視覺化  
  
267  
00:17:35.129 --> 00:17:40.638  
In this graph, you see the p-values for  
100,000 studies,  
這張圖是100,000項研究的p值次數分配  
  
268  
00:17:40.638 --> 00:17:44.707  
where every study had  
50% statistical power.  
而且每項研究統計考驗力都是50%  
  
269  
00:17:44.707 --> 00:17:49.521  
This means that it's 50% probable  
that we'll observe a p-value  
也就是說做一次這項研究有50%的機率  
獲得小於0.05的p值  
  
270  
00:17:49.521 --> 00:17:51.847  
that's smaller than 0.05.  
也就是說做一次這項研究有50%的機率  
獲得小於0.05的p值  
  
271  
00:17:51.847 --> 00:17:56.649  
If we look at the p-value distribution,  
we indeed see that it's much more likely  
仔細看這張圖會發現  
獲得微小p值的可能性比大p值高很多  
  
272  
00:17:56.649 --> 00:18:00.625  
to observe small p-values,  
than it is to observe high p-values.  
仔細看這張圖會發現  
獲得微小p值的可能性比大p值高很多  
  
273  
00:18:00.625 --> 00:18:07.422  
And if we look at the leftmost bar,  
we see that indeed 50,000 of the 100,000  
特別是最左邊的這一條  
是其中50,000項研究p值累積而成  
  
274  
00:18:07.422 --> 00:18:12.966  
simulated studies yield a p-value  
that falls between 0 and 0.05.  
這些p值都落在0與0.05之間  
  
275  
00:18:12.966 --> 00:18:16.577  
Now, we might want to increase  
the statistical power a little bit.  
接著把統計考驗力提高一些(80%)  
  
276  
00:18:16.577 --> 00:18:21.054  
You see that with higher power  
we have basically pushed more of  
會看到小於0.05的p值會增加  
推高分配左側的高度  
  
277  
00:18:21.054 --> 00:18:25.632  
the p-values below the significance  
threshold of 0.05.  
會看到小於0.05的p值會增加  
推高分配左側的高度  
  
278  
00:18:25.632 --> 00:18:28.926  
Here we have 80,000 of the 100,000  
有顯著結果的模擬研究次數來到80,000次  
  
279  
00:18:28.926 --> 00:18:32.552  
simulated studies that  
yield a significant effect.  
有顯著結果的模擬研究次數來到80,000次  
  
280  
00:18:32.552 --> 00:18:35.677  
If we increase the statistical  
power even more, to 95%,  
若是再把統計考驗力增加到95%  
  
281  
00:18:35.677 --> 00:18:38.681  
we now see that most of  
the p-values that we'll observe,  
因為確實存在真實效果  
  
282  
00:18:38.681 --> 00:18:42.629  
given that there is a true effect,  
will fall below the significance level.  
幾乎所有研究的p值都在顯著水準之下  
  
283  
00:18:44.661 --> 00:18:49.723  
So which p-values can you  
expect when there is no effect?  
那麼如果沒有真實效果的p值分配是什麼樣子？  
  
284  
00:18:49.723 --> 00:18:52.301  
I really never knew this myself.  
以前我從未仔細想過  
  
285  
00:18:52.301 --> 00:18:55.285  
I thought that p-values might  
be distributed in a way that,  
我以為這種情況大於顯著水準的p值  
會比較多，次數分配右側會比較高  
  
286  
00:18:55.285 --> 00:18:58.454  
if there's no effect,  
we'll see a lot of very high p-values.  
我以為這種情況大於顯著水準的p值  
會比較多，次數分配右側會比較高  
  
287  
00:18:58.454 --> 00:19:01.939  
Or I thought that it's possible  
that maybe they're distributed  
或者是變成中間較高的常態分配  
  
288  
00:19:01.939 --> 00:19:05.167  
as sort of a normal distribution,  
but instead it turns out,  
或者是變成中間較高的常態分配  
  
289  
00:19:05.167 --> 00:19:08.926  
that when there is no effect,  
p-values are uniformly distributed.  
結果出乎我的意料，  
實際是形成均勻分配  
  
290  
00:19:08.926 --> 00:19:11.608  
Every p-value is equally likely.  
也就是獲得任何p值的可能性是相同的  
  
291  
00:19:11.608 --> 00:19:15.428  
And it also makes a lot of  
sense if you understand it.  
數據模擬也能讓我們了解這是怎麼回事  
  
292  
00:19:15.428 --> 00:19:20.466  
In this case, we have simulated 100,000  
studies where there is no true effect.  
這是100,000項沒有真實效果的研究模擬結果  
  
293  
00:19:20.466 --> 00:19:24.380  
And you see that, no matter where  
you look in the distribution,  
如圖所示橫軸上的任何一個p值  
  
294  
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:28.384  
low p-values or high p-values,  
they're all equally likely.  
從高到低出現的可能性都是相等的  
  
295  
00:19:28.384 --> 00:19:31.175  
Now this makes sense because in this way,  
這樣的結果是很合理的  
  
296  
00:19:31.175 --> 00:19:36.281  
when there is a uniform distribution  
it means that 5% of the p-values that  
沒有真實效果的研究考驗力接近顯著水準  
  
297  
00:19:36.281 --> 00:19:41.179  
we observe when there is no effect,  
fall below the 0.05 threshold.  
造成僅有其中5%的p值出現在顯著水準之下  
  
298  
00:19:41.179 --> 00:19:45.735  
So when there's no effect, we have a 5%  
probability of making a type one error of  
沒有真實效果的研究會有5%的型一錯誤率  
  
299  
00:19:45.735 --> 00:19:50.176  
saying there is a significant effect  
when there's actually nothing going on.  
也就是沒有效果卻出現顯著結果的情況  
  
300  
00:19:50.176 --> 00:19:55.134  
So here you can see this small type  
one error rate highlighted in red.  
把最左邊的這一條挑出來仔細看  
  
301  
00:19:55.134 --> 00:19:58.419  
So this is what it means  
to make a type one error.  
高度恰好等於型一錯誤率  
  
302  
00:19:58.419 --> 00:20:02.796  
The reason that it's 5% is because  
there's a uniform p-value distribution.  
為何顯著水準約定俗成0.05，  
正是因為這樣的均勻分配  
  
303  
00:20:02.796 --> 00:20:07.406  
If you would increase your  
alpha level to 0.10 there's  
就算把顯著水準提高到0.10  
  
304  
00:20:07.406 --> 00:20:11.840  
still 10% of the p-values  
that fall below 0.10.  
數據模擬告訴我們只有10%的p值落於0.10之下  
  
305  
00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:16.624  
To conclude, it's important to understand  
how to correctly interpret the p-value.  
總歸一句，正確推論p值的意義是很重要的  
  
306  
00:20:16.624 --> 00:20:21.790  
Its use is often criticized because people  
incorrectly interpret what p-values mean.  
p值的用途常被人詬病  
是因為多數人錯誤推論p值的意義  
  
307  
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.889  
And I hope that after this lecture,  
you won't be one of them.  
希望上完這一講的你不再犯和多數人一樣的錯誤  
  
308  
00:20:25.889 --> 00:20:30.100
