[簡介三種推論統計方法]  
  
2  
00:00:09.423 --> 00:00:12.718  
In this lecture we'll talk about three  
different ways in which you can draw  
這段影片來簡單談談三種對資料  
  
3  
00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:15.070  
statistical inferences from your data.  
進行統計推論的方法  
  
4  
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.650  
We can see that there are three  
main questions that you can  
我們首先來看三種不同解決問題的角度  
  
5  
00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.120  
ask which are all related to  
different statistical approaches.  
其分別與三種統計推論方法有關  
  
6  
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.732  
So let's take a look at  
each of these in-turn.  
讓我們一個一個來談  
  
7  
00:00:24.732 --> 00:00:25.747  
Now in statistics,  
運用統計方法  
  
8  
00:00:25.747 --> 00:00:29.930  
we'll see that there's basically one  
truth that we all try to figure out.  
基本上我們期望能發掘那唯一的事實/真理  
  
9  
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.210  
But the paths toward this truth, there  
are many different ways to try to do this.  
不過到達事實/真理的途徑有很多條  
  
10  
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.410  
One useful metaphor that I think can  
help you think about these differences  
我想用印度教徒的修行法門(瑜珈)，來比喻說明  
  
11  
00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.960  
is if we look at Hinduism.  
三種統計推論方法的差別  
  
12  
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.120  
The Karma yoga, the Jnana yoga,  
and the Bhakti yoga.  
其中三種法門：業瑜珈(Karma),信瑜珈(Bhakti), 智瑜珈(Jnana)  
(英文說明順序有誤，字幕才正確)  
  
13  
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.542  
Now if you see what the Hinduist  
book [UNKNOWN says about this  
薄伽梵歌描述三種法門達到功德圓滿的要旨  
  
14  
00:00:50.542 --> 00:00:56.040  
there's basically a path of action, a path  
of devotion and a path of knowledge.  
付諸行動、堅定信仰、愛智求真  
  
15  
00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.400  
And I think there's a nice relation  
to make between these three paths and  
三種修行法門與三種統計推論方法解決問題的角度  
  
16  
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.930  
three questions that you can  
ask if you do statistics.  
有巧妙的相似之處  
  
17  
00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.590  
Now, Royall talks about these three  
different questions that one might ask.  
Royall曾歸納出三種尋求問題解答的觀點  
  
18  
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.140  
And he differentiates between what  
should I do, what should I believe and  
他試著分辨問題本質的不同，包括我該做什麼？我該相信什麼？  
  
19  
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.180  
what's the relative evidence?  
以及我有沒有得到互相對比的證據？  
  
20  
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.400  
And we see that these are three  
different statistical approaches  
這三種不同尋求問題解答的途徑  
  
21  
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.310  
that we can use to draw  
inferences from data.  
將決定不同方式來運用資料進行推論  
  
22  
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.560  
The first is the path of action.  
先談付諸行動之道  
  
23  
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.380  
The path of action uses rules to  
govern our behavior such that,  
此法門講究依循規則行事  
  
24  
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.930  
in the long run, we won't make  
a fool out of ourselves too often.  
只要依規則行動，我們就不會被愚弄人心的想法迷惑  
  
25  
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.910  
Now this approach uses p-values and  
alpha levels to either make a decision to  
付諸行動之道運用p值與顯著水準的規則  
  
26  
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.880  
reject the null hypothesis, or to accept  
the null hypothesis, or if you want  
決定拒絕虛無假設，還是接受虛無假設  
  
27  
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.900  
to remain in doubt about whether  
the alternative hypothesis is true or not.  
還有保持對立假設是否為真的懷疑  
  
28  
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.520  
This is a rule to govern our  
behavior in the long run.  
這個規則一直指引我們運用統計的行為  
  
29  
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.198  
It's important to keep in mind that  
this doesn't tell you anything about one  
必須銘記在心的是  
這個規則不會告訴你現在正在做的測試  
  
30  
00:01:56.198 --> 00:01:58.077  
single test that you're performing.  
會是什麼樣的結果  
  
31  
00:01:58.077 --> 00:02:02.150  
So any current test might  
be either true or false.  
因此任何一次測試結果可能為真也可能為假  
  
32  
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.470  
We don't know but  
what we know is that in the long run,  
雖然我們無從得知  
不過依照規則多做幾次測試就能掌握到  
  
33  
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.480  
there's a certain percentage of  
the time that will be correct.  
有多少次測試結果為真的比例  
  
34  
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.670  
So this is the main goal  
of the path of action.  
這也是付諸行動之道的首要目標  
  
35  
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.420  
Making decisions about what you should do.  
決定你該做的事(拒絕或接受虛無假設)  
  
36  
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.650  
The path of knowledge, the second way,  
focuses on likelihoods.  
愛智求真之道的修行是靠「似然性」(likelihoods)  
  
37  
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.690  
And it tries to answer the question  
what the likelihood is  
此法門講究要找到似然性才能解決問題  
  
38  
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.650  
of different hypotheses given  
the data that you have collected.  
不同假設的似然性是根據你所收集到的資料而定  
  
39  
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.330  
Let's take a look at the situation  
where you flip a coin ten times.  
我們拿丟一枚硬幣十次為例子  
  
40  
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.480  
This is an old Dutch  
from when I was young.  
這裡有十枚我小時候(歐元未發行前的)舊荷蘭硬幣  
  
41  
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.240  
And we see that there are six heads and four tales.  
其中六枚正面朝上  
四枚反面朝上  
  
42  
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.160  
So if you flip this, if you flip a coin  
ten times and this is the data that you  
如果把這十枚當成你丟一枚硬幣十次的結果  
  
43  
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.100  
have observed, you can ask yourself  
the question, is this coin biased or not?  
你覺得這一枚是不是公正的硬幣呢  
  
44  
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.230  
So what is the likelihood  
that this is a fair where  
要如何用似然性評斷這次結果  
  
45  
00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.960  
every option comes up 50% of the time?  
是出自一枚公正的硬幣(正反面各50%)  
  
46  
00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.099  
Or what's the likelihood  
that this is a biased coin?  
或者這樣問  
這是一枚不公正硬幣的似然性有多大?  
  
47  
00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.480  
Now we can plot the likelihood function  
given the data that we have observed.  
若把手上的資料放進似然函數(likelihood function)  
我們能畫出這樣的圖  
  
48  
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.530  
Let's take a look at  
the likelihood function.  
讓我們仔細端詳這道似然函數  
  
49  
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.930  
So this curves tells us all  
the likelihood of different  
圖中的曲線是所有似然值(縱軸)  
  
50  
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.580  
hypotheses given the data that we have.  
對應手上資料能支持的假設(橫軸)之集合  
  
51  
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.600  
Now we've observed six heads,  
so you can see that this,  
根據手上六枚正面的結果(0.6)  
就可知道這結果的似然值(0.25)  
  
52  
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.830  
according to the likelihood function,  
is the most likely possibility, but  
也是這道似然函數的最大估計值  
  
53  
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.350  
we can also calculate the likelihood ratio.  
另外我們也可以計算不同似然值的比值(likelihood ratio)  
  
54  
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.320  
How much more likely is the data  
that we have given a fair coin?  
若為公正硬幣投出的結果(0.5)  
其似然值是多少(0.2)  
  
55  
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.578  
And we see that this is  
not very impressive.  
我們會發現兩種結果的似然值很接近  
(0.25/0.2 = 1.25)  
  
56  
00:03:22.578 --> 00:03:24.810  
The likelihood ratio's supposed to be 1,  
當兩種假設(0.6 vs 0.5)沒有差別的話  
  
57  
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.680  
if there's no difference between different  
hypothesis, and this is pretty close to 1.  
理論上似然值比值會是1  
而這個例子裡似然值比值相當接近1(1.25)  
  
58  
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.690  
Later on in the course, we'll talk about  
how you can really calculate these things.  
之後的課程我們會學習如何計算  
  
59  
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.680  
The last option is the path of belief.  
最後來談堅定信仰之道  
  
60  
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.870  
Now we have flipped a coin ten times, and  
we saw that it came up heads six times.  
同樣是丟一枚硬幣十次，得到其中六次正面朝上的結果  
  
61  
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.060  
Now if you see this, do you really believe  
that the coin in the long run will come up  
你相信不管做幾次測試，都會得到這樣的結果嗎？  
  
62  
00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.390  
heads 60% of the time?  
都會有 60% 的測試結果是正面朝上嗎？  
  
63  
00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.990  
Now that seems rather unlikely.  
應該不會  
  
64  
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.760  
You have previous beliefs about coins, and  
因為你對硬幣有先驗信念(prior belief)  
  
65  
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.280  
you have a very strong belief  
that most coins are fair.  
這信念讓你相信大多數硬幣是公正的  
  
66  
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.260  
So in the long run you might say,  
well, I've observed this.  
如果真的能做很多次測試，你應該會說  
「我會看到好多次公正結果(0.5)」  
  
67  
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.300  
This one time there were six heads, but  
「雖然這次是六枚正面朝上」  
  
68  
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.300  
I don't really believe that this is what I  
will see if I continue flipping the coin.  
「除非繼續測試下去，否則我不會真的相信」  
  
69  
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.480  
I think, still, that 50% probability  
of heads is what's going to happen  
「我想總會有很多次，正反面朝上的次數相等」  
  
70  
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.460  
if I do this over and over again.  
「只要我可以反覆做同樣的測試」  
  
71  
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:20.560  
So you see that in this case, the data  
did not really change your prior beliefs.  
這樣的想法反映出一次測試結果並不能改變先驗信念  
  
72  
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.400  
And this path is known  
as Bayesian statistics,  
這也是貝氏統計的法門  
  
73  
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.060  
which allows you to express evidence  
in terms of the degrees of belief.  
根據手上的證據推測信念程度  
  
74  
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.168  
So how much do you believe  
in a certain hypothesis?  
那麼，你有多相信你的假設呢?  
  
75  
00:04:31.168 --> 00:04:34.970  
So these three different paths, the path  
of action, the path of devotion, and  
我們簡單談了付諸行動之道  
堅定信仰之道  
  
76  
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.460  
the path of knowledge.  
以及愛智求真之道  
  
77  
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.180  
We can sort of make a relationship to  
Neyman-Pearson statistics, which is  
三大法門對應到統計推論，首先是  
「尼曼-皮爾森統計」相當於「付諸行動」  
  
78  
00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.390  
the path of action using alpha levels to  
decide between the null hypothesis and  
講求運用顯著水準決定要接受虛無假設  
  
79  
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.150  
the alternate hypothesis.  
還是對立假設  
  
80  
00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.448  
Bayesian statistics, where we talk about  
the degree of belief in hypothesis.  
「堅定信仰」的「貝氏統計」則在計算對假設而生信念程度  
  
81  
00:04:51.448 --> 00:04:55.509  
And likelihoods which tell us something  
about relative evidence between different  
「愛智求真」要評估證據支持不同假設的「似然性」  
  
82  
00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:56.200  
hypothesis.  
「愛智求真」要評估證據支持不同假設的「似然性」  
  
83  
00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.580  
Now, in the history of statistics, we see  
that there's a lot of discussion going on  
在漫長的統計史裡，常看到不同法門之間的  
  
84  
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.390  
between different sides in this debate.  
討論與爭辯  
  
85  
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.470  
And if you want to know how nasty science  
can get, then I invite you to take a look  
若想見識科學家之間怎麼打筆戰  
我建議去找找看  
  
86  
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.610  
at the discussion in the scientific  
literature between this person on  
這些大師論文之中的討論，特別是  
  
87  
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.850  
the left, Jerzey Neyman, and  
the person on the right, Ronald Fisher.  
尼曼(左)與費雪(右)的論文來看看  
  
88  
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.290  
Now, Jerzey Neyman is  
about the path of action.  
尼曼是付諸行動之道的宗師  
  
89  
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.505  
And Ronald Fisher uses p-values  
in a slightly different way.  
而費雪則以不同的路數運用p值  
  
90  
00:05:21.505 --> 00:05:23.780  
P-values as a measure of evidence.  
這裡談的p值是證據力的測量值  
  
91  
00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.520  
Now, Ronald Fisher is a genius, one of  
the few geniuses that we have in science.  
費雪是科學界普遍公認的絕世奇才之一  
  
92  
00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.120  
He's not only a godfather of statistics,  
他不只是統計學的教父  
  
93  
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.542  
he worked a lot on introducing  
analysis of variance, for example.  
開創許多統計方法，  
像是變異數分析  
  
94  
00:05:34.542 --> 00:05:38.360  
But he's also a very respected  
scholar in the field of biology,  
他也是生物學界的一代巨擘  
  
95  
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.660  
where he did groundbreaking work as well.  
因為他也為生物學留下許多奠基之作  
  
96  
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:44.550  
So this is no doubt a very smart  
individual, but there's a lot of debate  
有天兩大宗師狹路相逢，他們要爭辯  
  
97  
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.780  
about the way that he uses p-values  
to draw inferences from your data.  
如何使用p值對資料進行推論  
  
98  
00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.670  
So if there's a discussion between these  
two individuals, you can say, well,  
假想你(己知假設檢定)穿越到了這一天  
兩人辯論的高潮時刻  
  
99  
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:57.950  
the Neyman-Pierson approach to inference  
is definitely the best way, the most  
你大概會對尼曼說，他的推論方法是最好的  
  
100  
00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.255  
coherent way, to draw inferences from  
data using alpha levels and the p-value.  
最有邏輯的方法  
因為是靠顯著水準與p值直接推論資料  
  
101  
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.580  
So Neyman would be really happy,  
say, haha, after all these years and  
尼曼聽罷必會對費雪大笑說  
「哈哈，多年之後...」  
  
102  
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.740  
this intense discussion that we had,  
I've won.  
「你我爭論的結果，是我贏了」  
  
103  
00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.670  
My way of doing statistics is  
the only logical approach to draw  
「我的統計推論方法是唯一有邏輯的方式」  
  
104  
00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.830  
statistical inferences.  
「我的統計推論方法是唯一有邏輯的方式」  
  
105  
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.150  
On the other hand,  
Fisher might not be too sad.  
但看費雪這一邊，他應該面不改色  
  
106  
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.050  
He might say, forget it.  
他說「你(尼曼)別傻了」  
  
107  
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.790  
No one knows who you are,  
which is in general true.  
「就算你的方法被眾人接受，  
也不會有人知道你是誰」  
  
108  
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.490  
I think not a lot of people have heard of  
the Neyman-Pearson approach of statistics.  
「我相信只有一小撮人知道你和皮爾森的名字」  
  
109  
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.830  
And he would be pretty happy  
that everybody uses p-values in,  
費雪反而會很高興地說  
「未來人人都會用p值的時代」  
  
110  
00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.340  
well, arguably, not the optimal way,  
but at least the way that he proposed.  
「雖然大多數人不會用得很好，  
但是使用的方式是我首先提出來的」  
  
111  
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.020  
And, well,  
he gets a lot of respect for this.  
他說得一點都沒錯，  
假設檢定的觀念是費雪先提出來的  
  
112  
00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.220  
You might not know this, but  
the F-distribution, the F-value  
你也許還不知道，當你做變異數分析時(ANOVA)  
  
113  
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.950  
that you calculate in an ANOVA, is  
actually named after Fisher in his honor.  
會遇到的F分配、F值  
就是以費雪的首字母(F)命名  
  
114  
00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.040  
All right, so  
these two sides are debating, but  
再回來看辯論大會  
當兩邊爭得面紅耳赤時  
  
115  
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.560  
now we see that Bayesian statistics  
is on the rise in recent years.  
貝氏統計正悄悄地登上爭辯的舞台  
  
116  
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.484  
This is Reverend Thomas Bayes,  
or actually probably not.  
這位是托馬斯·貝葉斯神父  
也可能不是  
  
117  
00:06:58.484 --> 00:07:01.630  
This is a picture that's  
circulating that might be him, but  
這張畫像有傳言說是他本人  
  
118  
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:04.340  
it's doubtful that it's actually him.  
也有傳言說不是  
  
119  
00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.770  
Nevertheless, we'll use it in this course  
to illustrate the Bayesian perspective.  
不管如何，我們都用他的姓氏稱呼他帶起  
的觀點(Bayesian perspective)  
  
120  
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.410  
And he would say,  
gentleman, Quit fighting.  
他穿越來到之後會說  
「兩位先生，別再爭了」  
  
121  
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.180  
Who cares about these frequentist  
approaches to statistics that you  
「誰會在乎你們發展的"次數分配主義"在統計學裡有多重要」  
  
122  
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.110  
think are important.  
「誰會在乎你們發展的"次數分配主義"在統計學裡有多重要」  
  
123  
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.430  
Because everybody in the future will  
use Bayesian statistics anyway.  
「未來是人人使用貝氏統計學的時代」  
  
124  
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.450  
We can see whether that's true or not.  
我們即將見證究竟這時代會不會來臨  
  
125  
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.447  
And maybe Neyman would respond, well,  
但此時尼曼回應他  
  
126  
00:07:24.447 --> 00:07:27.863  
I don't have a really high prior  
that this is really going to happen.  
「我對這事可沒有這麼高的先驗信念」  
  
127  
00:07:27.863 --> 00:07:29.363  
Which of course, is a sly joke,  
當然這是尼曼反諷貝氏的笑話  
  
128  
00:07:29.363 --> 00:07:33.470  
because he's using prior information  
to draw an inference in this case.  
尼曼用自已的先驗知識推測貝氏的預言  
  
129  
00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:36.730  
And you see that when there's a discussion  
between Bayesian statistics and  
一旁的你會以為這突然亂入的貝式統計  
  
130  
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:41.130  
frequentist statistics, all of sudden, of  
course, these two become perfect friends.  
與次數分配主義(尼曼-皮爾森取向)  
是好哥兒們  
  
131  
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:43.790  
They say, of course, very good joke.  
三位大師會認為你的看法是個笑話  
  
132  
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.809  
And they will be in agreement  
about the way to do statistics.  
卻也會同意你對統計推論的看法  
  
133  
00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:52.330  
Now the third approach is  
the likelihood approach.  
最後我們來看似然性取向  
  
134  
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:57.620  
It's not very popular at the moment, but  
likelihoods underlay Bayesian statistics.  
雖然這方法目前還不流行，但似然性是貝氏統計的基礎  
  
135  
00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.145  
And the difference between likelihoods and  
Bayesian statistics,  
兩者之間的差異在於  
  
136  
00:08:01.145 --> 00:08:05.223  
is that likelihoods do use the relative  
evidence that's present in the data,  
似然性是根據目前資料呈現的相對證據  
  
137  
00:08:05.223 --> 00:08:06.917  
as Bayesian statisticians do.  
正如貝氏統計學家的做法  
  
138  
00:08:06.917 --> 00:08:10.840  
But it doesn't rely on  
this subjective prior.  
但是似然性取向的方法不在乎先驗信念  
  
139  
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.060  
One of the proponents of this  
approach is Rich Royall.  
Rich Royall是其中一位支持者  
  
140  
00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:18.190  
And he might say something that nobody  
really cares about your subjective opinion  
他會說研究者在使用統計推論時  
沒人會在乎研究者的主觀想法  
  
141  
00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:20.350  
when you draw inferences from data.  
他會說研究者在使用統計推論時  
沒人會在乎研究者的主觀想法  
  
142  
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:25.450  
So you should ignore this subjective  
prior and only rely on the likelihood.  
所以研究者不必管主觀先驗機率  
只要靠似然值就行  
  
143  
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.630  
To which Thomas Bayes might say,  
come on, don't be such a nuisance.  
但是貝葉斯神父大概會回應他  
「別這麼天真」  
  
144  
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.260  
Nobody even knows what  
likelihood paradigm is.  
「沒有先驗信念就沒人知道似然函數的樣子」  
  
145  
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.230  
At this moment this might be true but  
we'll see you can use it for  
此時也許神父是對的，不過在之後的課程裡  
  
146  
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:38.270  
certain useful things later  
on in these lectures.  
你會學到似然性取向有用處的地方  
  
147  
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.466  
Now, it's very important to  
realize that in this debate,  
像這樣的爭論，你該了解到  
  
148  
00:08:42.466 --> 00:08:45.630  
which sometimes feels a little  
bit like Microsoft versus Apple,  
有點像微軟與蘋果孰優孰劣之爭  
  
149  
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.943  
there's always this  
clash between two sides.  
兩邊總會有爭執  
  
150  
00:08:47.943 --> 00:08:52.850  
And people will start to argue vehemently  
between these two different approaches.  
也會吸引人們跳進去參戰  
  
151  
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:57.050  
For you, it's very important that you  
can use whatever answers your question.  
對於這門課的同學  
重要的是了解該用什麼角度解決問題  
  
152  
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:58.370  
And that's really the main point.  
才是學習這門課程的重點  
  
153  
00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:59.480  
It's not either, or.  
不是只能使用一種方法，而是  
  
154  
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.850  
You can even combine these  
approaches if you want to.  
你可以融合兩種甚至三種取向  
  
155  
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:07.845  
So the important take-home message here is  
that there are three different approaches  
我要給各位的記憶重點是透過參與這門課程學習  
  
156  
00:09:07.845 --> 00:09:10.500  
in how you can draw  
inferences from your data.  
三種從資料進行統計推論的方法  
  
157  
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.687  
These all answer a question  
you might be interested in.  
三種方法都能回答你有興趣的問題  
  
158  
00:09:13.687 --> 00:09:16.907  
And the main thing is that you  
realize that there are all  
一旦你掌握了所有統計推論的方法  
  
159  
00:09:16.907 --> 00:09:18.867  
these different approaches, so  
一旦你掌握了所有統計推論的方法  
  
160  
00:09:18.867 --> 00:09:22.865  
you can ask the question that will  
give you the answer that you want.  
你便可以正確問出那條你真正想得到答案的問題  
  
161  
00:09:22.865 --> 00:09:25.959
