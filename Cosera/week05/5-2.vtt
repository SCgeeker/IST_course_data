評估樣本數

2
00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:13.920
When you design a new study, one of the most important things to keep in
設計一項新研究的重要課題之一是

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.859
mind is the sample size that you want to collect.
決定要收集的樣本數目

4
00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.490
We see that in many studies sample sizes are too small.
許多研究文獻的樣本數都很小

5
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.401
And I want to give you some practical advice on how to decide upon a sample size
這一講要給你一些決定樣本數的可實行建議

6
00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:26.276
for a future study that you'll do.
這一講要給你一些決定樣本數的可實行建議

7
00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:31.016
So if you would design a new study, how would you determine the sample size?
設計一項新研究時，你如何決定樣本數

8
00:00:31.016 --> 00:00:32.644
Take a moment to think about this.
這值得花點時間考慮

9
00:00:34.052 --> 00:00:38.267
There are different approaches to do this, and we'll talk about them in this lecture.
決定方法有很多，以下談談這些方法

10
00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:42.694
What I used to do, when I was doing my PhD, was either use exactly the same
我進行自已的博士論文研究時，曾考慮過

11
00:00:42.694 --> 00:00:47.503
number of participants as a previous study had used or I would use a heuristic.
要收集與之前研究相同的人數
還是採用一些訣竅

12
00:00:47.503 --> 00:00:52.749
In my time, it was quite common to use a sample size of 15 participants for
那時候獨立組設計習慣每一組招募15人

13
00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:55.430
each between-subjects condition.
那時候獨立組設計習慣每一組招募15人

14
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.425
Nowadays, this number has increased a little bit.
製作這個課程時，數目已經稍微增加

15
00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:01.947
I see that people very often use about 25 participants for
我看到多數獨立組研究是每一組招募25人

16
00:01:01.947 --> 00:01:04.207
each between-subjects condition.
我看到多數獨立組研究是每一組招募25人

17
00:01:04.207 --> 00:01:05.747
But is this sufficient?
但是這樣子就夠了嗎？

18
00:01:05.747 --> 00:01:09.212
And if not, what should you do instead of relying on these heuristics?
如果不夠，新的研究該怎麼做？

19
00:01:11.655 --> 00:01:16.395
Now first, let's realize what the problem is if you collect small samples.
首先讓我們搞清楚收集樣本太小會有什麼問題

20
00:01:16.395 --> 00:01:21.674
Small samples always have large variation leading to very inaccurate estimates.
小樣本總是造成較大變異
連帶導致不良的估計

21
00:01:21.674 --> 00:01:26.721
But when you perform an hypothesis test, they also lead to high Type 2 error rates.
小樣本還會造成偏高的型二錯誤率

22
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:30.865
Which means that you perform a study, you do a statistical test, and
也就是小樣本資料的統計檢定

23
00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:35.954
even when there is true effect, the test result is not statistically significant.
在真實效果存在時，檢定不顯著的錯誤

24
00:01:35.954 --> 00:01:40.206
It's important to prevent this, both Type 2 errors and inaccurate estimates.
型二錯誤和不良的估計都是要避免的

25
00:01:42.212 --> 00:01:47.414
This is a nice visualization by Schonbrodt and Perugini who show
Schonbrodt與Perugini做了不錯的視覺化範例

26
00:01:47.414 --> 00:01:53.211
how the variation in data decreases as the sample size becomes larger.
展示資料的變異下降與增加樣本數的關係

27
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:57.752
From the left to the right, we see
a continuously increasing sample size.
橫軸由左至右的連續數值代表增加的樣本數

28
00:01:57.752 --> 00:01:59.538
We also see a black line.
留意每一條黑線的走勢

29
00:01:59.538 --> 00:02:03.907
And in this case, the black line is actually the effect size estimate from
每條線是從收集的資料，以對應的樣本數

30
00:02:03.907 --> 00:02:07.511
a study they performed as they collected more and more data.
計算得到的真實效果量

31
00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:11.052
So the effect size was calculated after every participants and
也就是收完一位參與者資料

32
00:02:11.052 --> 00:02:13.066
it's plotted here as a black line.
就計算一次效果量的總成

33
00:02:13.066 --> 00:02:16.433
You can see that there's a huge drop in the effect size.
好幾條線的走勢很明顯是下降的

34
00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:20.740
And what they show is that actually such variation is possible,
整體也顯示真實資料的變異程度

35
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.182
because small samples have very large variation.
樣本越少變異越大

36
00:02:24.182 --> 00:02:28.885
I referred to this as sailing the seas of chaos into what Schonbrodt and
我把這樣的景觀比喻為穿越暴風雨

37
00:02:28.885 --> 00:02:31.843
Perugini named the corridor of stability.
抵達寧靜迴廊之旅

38
00:02:31.843 --> 00:02:33.935
On the left you see huge waves.
圖左邊的好似濤天巨浪

39
00:02:33.935 --> 00:02:37.647
If you have small samples, then your data is riding these huge waves.
小樣本的估計值猶如被浪頭頂著的小船

40
00:02:37.647 --> 00:02:40.060
Effects can be very large or very small.
效果量可大可小

41
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.167
The variation is substantial.
全由資料變異決定

42
00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:45.692
Now as you enter the corridor of stability, as Schonbrodt &
進入Schonbrodt與Perugini所稱的寧靜迴廊時

43
00:02:45.692 --> 00:02:50.061
Perugini call this, you see that the variation becomes much less severe.
資料變異變得沒那麼劇烈

44
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:54.278
There's still some variation around the true effect size estimate, but
雖然真實效果量的估計值還是有些變異

45
00:02:54.278 --> 00:02:57.759
at this point, you're making very accurate estimations.
過這這一點之後，估計值明顯更正確

46
00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:01.946
Now we see that researchers failed to take the sample size into account when they
採用小樣本資料的研究，研究者很難提出

47
00:03:01.946 --> 00:03:03.083
design new studies.
有說服力的解釋

48
00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.524
And this is nothing new.
這並不是新聞

49
00:03:04.524 --> 00:03:09.899
We've known this for about 50 years, and only now it is very slowly changing.
50年前就有人提出警告，但學術界改變很慢

50
00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:13.920
In certain literatures where sample sizes are very expensive, so
在某些域收集資料成本極高

51
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.581
if you want to collect a large number of people, you have to have a lot of money,
經費充裕才有可能收集大樣本資料的研究

52
00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:22.313
such as neuroscience, where we put people in fMRI scanners,
像是fMRI這類收集人腦活動的研究

53
00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:25.362
we see that there's really a huge power failure.
這篇論文指出嚴重的檢定力失效問題

54
00:03:25.362 --> 00:03:28.744
Studies are severely underpowered.
也就是多數神經科學研究的檢定力過低

55
00:03:28.744 --> 00:03:31.830
Interestingly, people have been saying this for
有趣的是這問題吵了這麼多年

56
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.162
years and years, and there are even papers that say that the studies of
還有新論文指出設定統計檢定力的研究

57
00:03:36.162 --> 00:03:40.286
statistical power don't have any effect on the power of studies.
對於提昇研究檢定力幫助有限

58
00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:44.463
This is slightly depressing, because here I'm talking about how you should
正在告訴你如何設計良好的研究，看到一篇

59
00:03:44.463 --> 00:03:48.705
design well-powered studies, even though past research has shown that this
論文說這些努力都是徒勞的

60
00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:51.679
does not have an effect on what researchers really do.
不免讓人有些喪氣

61
00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:54.620
But on the other hand, we see the things are now really changing.
另一方面，情勢也正在改變

62
00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.399
More and more journals are requiring what's known as a sample size
越來越多期刊要求作者提供樣本數決定策略

63
00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:59.418
justification.
越來越多期刊要求作者提供樣本數決定策略

64
00:03:59.418 --> 00:04:04.085
You need to explicitly write down why you selected this specific sample size.
作者要明確說明決定樣本數的理由

65
00:04:04.085 --> 00:04:08.247
So I seriously think that in the future we'll see a big change in this
我預見一些特定領域將有很大的變化

66
00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:09.277
specific area.
我預見一些特定領域將有很大的變化

67
00:04:09.277 --> 00:04:13.750
We see that studies in psychology often have very low statistical power.
現在已知許多心理學研究的檢定力偏低

68
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.845
Estimates average around 50%,
估計50%左右

69
00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:19.820
which means that, even if you have a true hypothesis, you only have
也就是說，就算有一個明確的假設

70
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.808
a 50% probability of actually observing a statistically significant finding.
只有50%的機會能獲得統計顯著的結果

71
00:04:24.808 --> 00:04:26.711
I think that if people realized this,
如果一般人都能了解這點

72
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:29.267
they would seriously reconsider doing the study,
會重新考慮當這行研究人員的意義

73
00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:33.378
because they only have 50% probability of finding an effect when it's there.
因為已知的發現只有50%是真的

74
00:04:33.378 --> 00:04:37.426
That doesn't seem to be worth all the effort to collect this data.
那何必要拼死拼活地收集資料

75
00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:42.865
Now, one reason for low powered studies is that people don't really
造成低檢定力研究橫行的原因之一是

76
00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:47.279
think about how to design their study and especially the sample size of their study.
多數研究者並未仔細設計研究，特別是樣本數

77
00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:49.659
But people use heuristics instead.
多數人都依賴慣例或秘訣

78
00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:51.630
Now, heuristics are always wrong.
多數慣例是錯誤的

79
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.020
You should never rely on heuristics to plan the sample size,
現在的你不該依此決定樣本數

80
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.214
no matter what the recommendation of this heuristic is.
不論你多認同相關的建議

81
00:04:58.214 --> 00:05:04.946
Whether it’s 10, 20, 50 people, you should always use a better approach and
不管要收集10,20還是50位參與者
應該要使用更好的方法

82
00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:08.982
more informed justification of your sample size.
還有有所本的樣本數評估策略

83
00:05:08.982 --> 00:05:11.091
Nowadays, journals ask you do this.
已經有期刊如此要求作者

84
00:05:11.091 --> 00:05:15.423
So you need to justify the sample size of a study.
有評估樣本數時

85
00:05:15.423 --> 00:05:19.120
The justification depends on the goal that you want to achieve.
應根據你的研究目標做評估

86
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.713
Let's consider different goals.
讓我們看看怎麼做

87
00:05:22.713 --> 00:05:27.176
In this graph, we can see again correlation between two variables.
這是兩個變項的散佈圖及相關係數

88
00:05:27.176 --> 00:05:30.247
We see a rather wide confidence interval.
其中的信賴區間範圍很寬

89
00:05:30.247 --> 00:05:32.652
In this case there are only ten observations.
這個例子只有十筆資料

90
00:05:32.652 --> 00:05:35.565
So the confidence interval is really wide.
才讓信賴區間這麼寬

91
00:05:35.565 --> 00:05:38.997
If we increase the sample size to 100 participants,
若增加到100筆資料

92
00:05:38.997 --> 00:05:42.877
we see that the confidence interval becomes much more narrow.
信賴區間明顯變窄

93
00:05:42.877 --> 00:05:46.575
If your goal is to design a study that will accurately
如果目的是想要獲得正確效果量的估計值

94
00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:50.611
estimate the true effect size, then having a sample size
達到可接受的估計正確性是決定樣本數的重點

95
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:54.914
that allows you to achieve a certain accuracy is a good goal.
達到可接受的估計正確性是決定樣本數的重點

96
00:05:54.914 --> 00:05:57.431
So one approach is to plan for accuracy.
所以估計值的正確性是一種好方法

97
00:05:57.431 --> 00:06:02.076
Select a sample size based on the width of a confidence interval.
也就是根據信賴區間的寬度決定樣本數

98
00:06:02.076 --> 00:06:05.519
A classic paper on this is Maxwell, Kelley and Rausch.
如果你想以估計正確性評估樣本數
建議參考Maxwell, Kelley與Rausch的經典論文

99
00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:10.484
I recommend that you can read this if you want to know how to design studies
如果你想以估計正確性評估樣本數
建議參考Maxwell, Kelley與Rausch的經典論文

100
00:06:10.484 --> 00:06:11.909
based on accuracy.
如果你想以估計正確性評估樣本數
建議參考Maxwell, Kelley與Rausch的經典論文

101
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:14.970
The second approach is to design a study so
第二種方法是根據指定的統計檢定力

102
00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.563
that it will have a specific statistical power.
第二種方法是根據指定的統計檢定力

103
00:06:18.563 --> 00:06:21.613
Now we already saw this graph earlier on in the course.
第一週課程已經看過這張圖

104
00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:25.613
And in this simulation, we have 50% power,
這是設定檢定力50%的模擬結果

105
00:06:25.613 --> 00:06:31.317
which means that 50% of the p-values end up in the leftmost bin.
所以最後有50%的p值集中於最左邊長條

106
00:06:31.317 --> 00:06:32.860
Now, you might think this is too low.
現在大家都知道50%並不高

107
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.136
You want to design a study which has much higher power.
你當然會希望提高研究的檢定力

108
00:06:36.136 --> 00:06:39.185
For example, 95% power.
像是95%

109
00:06:39.185 --> 00:06:42.651
So you can design a a study where you plan for power.
你可以據此設定你的研究

110
00:06:42.651 --> 00:06:47.489
You select the sample size based on the probability of observing a p-value
評估在這條件下，要得到小於0.05的p值

111
00:06:47.489 --> 00:06:49.117
smaller than 0.05.
需要的樣本數

112
00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:53.057
And in these cases we would do a priori power analysis based on an expected
因此你需要設定預期效果量
做事前考驗力分析

113
00:06:53.057 --> 00:06:53.839
effect size.
因此你需要設定預期效果量
做事前考驗力分析

114
00:06:56.534 --> 00:06:58.761
If we take a look at the power for
根據Cohen's d是0.5的獨立t檢定計算檢定力

115
00:06:58.761 --> 00:07:03.643
an independent T test with a coens D of 0.5, we can the sample size
根據Cohen's d是0.5的獨立t檢定計算檢定力

116
00:07:03.643 --> 00:07:08.375
that you need to have a substantial power can become quite large.
能得知要達到檢定力標準的樣本數很大

117
00:07:08.375 --> 00:07:13.629
Very often, if people start to perform power analysis, their first complaint is
許多人經常在做完檢定力分析之後抱怨

118
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:19.202
that the sample size that's recommended is much larger than they think is necessary.
需要的樣本數比想像中的多太多

119
00:07:19.202 --> 00:07:23.041
Now people seem to have some intuitive feel of the sample
這讓一些人覺得只要說定50%檢定力就夠了

120
00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:26.151
size that they need to achieve 50% power.
這讓一些人覺得只要說定50%檢定力就夠了

121
00:07:26.151 --> 00:07:31.138
As we see, the literature mainly has studies with about 50% power.
但是剛剛就提到
文獻數據的平均檢定力就是50%

122
00:07:31.138 --> 00:07:34.207
So in the beginning, you might be surprised by how many people you need.
所以第一次知道這方法的人
會對評估結果很驚訝

123
00:07:34.207 --> 00:07:36.479
If you want to have about 95% power,
如果想讓研究結果有95%檢定力

124
00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:40.678
you would need a sample size of about 100 people in each condition.
每組人數就要招募100人

125
00:07:40.678 --> 00:07:43.659
Which is quite a lot more than the 15 participants in
比我當年博士論文的每組15人多了好幾倍

126
00:07:43.659 --> 00:07:47.780
each between-subject condition that I designed when I was doing my PhD.
比我當年博士論文的每組15人多了好幾倍

127
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.666
So be prepared for slightly larger sample sizes.
所以請做好增加樣本數的心理準備

128
00:07:52.604 --> 00:07:56.632
Now when you base your power analysis on an effect size from the published
如果要根據文獻的整合效果量做檢定力分析

129
00:07:56.632 --> 00:07:58.424
literature, be very careful.
請務必小心

130
00:07:58.424 --> 00:08:03.003
We know that publication bias inflates effect size estimates in the literature.
已知出版偏誤會誇大效果量的估計值

131
00:08:03.003 --> 00:08:06.089
So you always want to be a little bit more conservative.
因此要採用較保守的評估

132
00:08:06.089 --> 00:08:08.785
A power analysis should be a starting point for
檢定力分析可以做新研究樣本數評估的起點

133
00:08:08.785 --> 00:08:11.419
designing the sample size in a future study.
檢定力分析可以做新研究樣本數評估的起點

134
00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:12.581
It should not be the end point.
但絕對不是終點

135
00:08:12.581 --> 00:08:16.262
So always be informed by more than the power analysis itself.
謹記檢定力分析的條件

136
00:08:18.491 --> 00:08:20.441
If you perform a power analysis,
執行一項檢定力分析

137
00:08:20.441 --> 00:08:24.351
always use unbiased effect size estimates in the power analysis.
最好採用不偏誤的效果量估計值

138
00:08:24.351 --> 00:08:27.710
So Hedges' g, epsilon, or omega.
像是Hedges' g, epsilon或omega

139
00:08:30.532 --> 00:08:34.504
If effect sizes are uncertain, there's not a lot to go on in the published
若是效果量不確定，像是文獻數量不足

140
00:08:34.504 --> 00:08:38.670
literature, or there's nothing comparable in the published literature,
缺少可彼此比較的文獻

141
00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:42.832
then sequential analyses are one way to let you look at the data as it comes in,
控制型一錯誤率的序列分析是一種可行的辦法

142
00:08:42.832 --> 00:08:45.296
while controlling your Type 1 error rates.
控制型一錯誤率的序列分析是一種可行的辦法

143
00:08:45.296 --> 00:08:47.179
So if there is huge uncertainty, but
如果幾乎不確定

144
00:08:47.179 --> 00:08:51.434
you still want to achieve a statistically significant result, that's the goal,
但你還是想得到統計顯著的結果

145
00:08:51.434 --> 00:08:55.628
then instead of doing an a priori power analysis, you can use sequential analysis
那不該做事前檢定力分析
而是做序列分析並收集資料直到統計顯著

146
00:08:55.628 --> 00:08:59.336
and collect data until you find a statistically significant effect, or
那不該做事前檢定力分析
而是做序列分析並收集資料直到統計顯著

147
00:08:59.336 --> 00:09:02.046
until you don't want to collect more participants.
或者到不想再收集樣本為止

148
00:09:05.286 --> 00:09:08.766
Now instead of planning for accuracy or power,
除了估計的正確性還有檢定力

149
00:09:08.766 --> 00:09:12.251
it's perfectly fine to plan for feasibility.
研究可行性也是不錯的評估條件

150
00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:17.137
You don't have infinite resources, infinite amount of time or money,
這方法適用在資源，時間和經費有限

151
00:09:17.137 --> 00:09:21.941
or sometimes the population that you want to collect data from is very,
或者要收集的樣本來源很難招募

152
00:09:21.941 --> 00:09:23.722
very difficult to reach.
或者要收集的樣本來源很難招募

153
00:09:23.722 --> 00:09:28.322
So in these cases the feasibility of collecting a large sample size
這時收集大樣本資料的可行性

154
00:09:28.322 --> 00:09:31.780
is limited by how easy it is to find participants.
取決於找到合適參與者的便利程度

155
00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:35.535
So, it's perfectly fine to select the sample size based on the time,
這時評估樣本數的最好參考
就是時間、經費、還有招募參與者的便利性

156
00:09:35.535 --> 00:09:38.667
the money, or the participants that you have available.
這時評估樣本數的最好參考
就是時間、經費、還有招募參與者的便利性

157
00:09:38.667 --> 00:09:40.598
This can also be a way to plan a study.
這也是設計研究能考慮的條件 

158
00:09:40.598 --> 00:09:44.560
This is just the best that you can do given the resources that you have.
根據手上的研究資源設計研究

159
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.854
And that's perfectly fine.
也是最好的策略

160
00:09:46.854 --> 00:09:51.009
Of course, in these situations, it might be that the statistical power is low, but
當然，這樣可能導致檢定力偏低

161
00:09:51.009 --> 00:09:53.992
in that case you might just want to estimate the effect size,
那麼報告只要提供效果量估計值

162
00:09:53.992 --> 00:09:56.174
instead of performing a statistical test.
不必做統計檢定

163
00:09:59.121 --> 00:10:01.822
You can also use Bayesian statistics.
也可以使用貝氏統計

164
00:10:01.822 --> 00:10:06.775
In Bayesian statistics, you don't have to specify the sample size before you start.
不必去管收集的樣本數

165
00:10:06.775 --> 00:10:10.964
You can collect data and continuing data collection until whenever you want.
收集到你認為結果適當時就好

166
00:10:10.964 --> 00:10:14.127
This quote by Edwards, Lindman, & Savage says,
這段話出自Edwards, Lindman, 與Savage的論文

167
00:10:14.127 --> 00:10:18.689
it is entirely appropriate to collect data until a point has been proven or
資料收集到能確證或否證論點的研究

168
00:10:18.689 --> 00:10:23.715
disproven, or until the data collector runs out of time, money, or patience.
與資料收集到研究者資源耗竭的研究都是一樣好的

169
00:10:23.715 --> 00:10:27.934
If we design a study based on the statistical power, this is a frequentist
以考驗力設計研究和評估樣本數是次數主義思維

170
00:10:27.934 --> 00:10:31.624
approach to designing a study and determining the sample size.
以考驗力設計研究和評估樣本數是次數主義思維

171
00:10:31.624 --> 00:10:36.230
But in Bayesian statistics, you just quantify the evidence that's in the data.
貝氏統計是以手上的資料評估證據力

172
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:39.401
And if you're not happy with the evidence you have,
今天你不滿意手上資料的證據力

173
00:10:39.401 --> 00:10:41.503
you can always collect more data.
可以繼續收集更多資料

174
00:10:41.503 --> 00:10:44.527
So Bayesian statistics is much more flexible.
貝氏統計本身給予研究者評估的彈性

175
00:10:44.527 --> 00:10:47.535
You can determine the sample size any way you want.
任何決定樣本數的方式都是合理的

176
00:10:47.535 --> 00:10:51.786
On the other hand, there is no easy way to control Type 1 errors.
另一方面，這也造成型一錯誤率不容易控制

177
00:10:51.786 --> 00:10:54.128
It's entirely uncontrolled, but
精確地說是完全沒控制

178
00:10:54.128 --> 00:10:59.210
it's just much more difficult to quantify the Type 1 error rates directly.
並且很難量化型一錯誤率

179
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:02.513
Nowadays, its becoming increasingly important to justify
今天的研究設計越來越講究評估樣本數

180
00:11:02.513 --> 00:11:05.242
the sample size of a study that you are designing.
今天的研究設計越來越講究評估樣本數

181
00:11:05.242 --> 00:11:08.659
In the past, we've seen that people designed underpowered and
過去文獻充斥太多低考驗力的結果

182
00:11:08.659 --> 00:11:12.464
inaccurate studies, and in the future, this really needs to change.
與估計不良的研究
未來這些情勢將被扭轉

183
00:11:12.464 --> 00:11:16.521
The sample size is a very important aspect of the design of a new study.
評估樣本數的設計新研究必做功課

184
00:11:16.521 --> 00:11:17.706
Don't ignore it.
務必謹慎為之

185
00:11:17.706 --> 00:11:22.179
