信賴區間

2
00:00:09.586 --> 00:00:13.834
In this lecture, we'll talk about how you can quantify the uncertainty surrounding
這一講談的是如何運用信賴區間量化不確定的估計值

3
00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:16.680
estimates with confidence intervals.
這一講談的是如何運用信賴區間量化不確定的估計值

4
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.210
We'll talk about the relationship between confidence intervals and P values,
以下將談到信賴區間與p值的關係

5
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.860
and how to correctly interpret a confidence interval.
還有如何正確解讀信賴區間

6
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.630
Now, if we do research, we very often collect data from a specific sample
很多研究是依目的收集特定樣本的資料

7
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.460
with the goal to generalize to an entire population.
再根據分析推測母群

8
00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.700
It's very often not feasible to collect information from the entire population.
但通常無法收集整個母群的資訊

9
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.360
If you examine people,
就像每一份問卷調查

10
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.770
then you cannot ask your questionnaire to everybody who's alive in the world.
不可能收集到全世界人類的回覆

11
00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.780
Now, sometimes it might be possible to get measurements from the entire population.
只有少數狀況才會收集到完整的母群資料

12
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.400
Let's say that your population is all human beings who ever walked on the moon.
就像對象是至今為止曾登陸月球的太空人們

13
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.790
Well, there are only 12 people who've done this so far, the 12 people on this slide.
只有這張投影片列出的十二位

14
00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.660
So if you want to know something about these 12 people, for example,
如果你的研究對象是曾經登月的太空人

15
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.530
their length, then you can just calculate it.
全部都在在這裡了

16
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.130
You don't need any statistics.
不需要任何統計

17
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.890
You don't need to generalize to a population because you've measured
也不必做任何推測
因為這十二位就是整個母群

18
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.030
the entire population.
也不必做任何推測
因為這十二位就是整個母群

19
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.440
Now most research, this is not feasible, so you collect data from a sample and
大多數研究很難收集完整的母群
只能從收集一部分樣本資料

20
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.470
then you try to generalize from this sample to the population.
然後以樣本推測母群

21
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.440
And whenever you do this, there's always some uncertainty.
然而推測總會有不確定的部分

22
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.500
Now, it's very important to always quantify and report the uncertainty
報告必須呈現估計不確定性的數量訊息
就像效果量的測量一樣

23
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.190
surrounding point estimates, for example an effect size measure.
報告必須呈現估計不確定性的數量訊息
就像效果量的測量一樣

24
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.300
Whenever you report a statistic that's very important, such as an effect size,
要呈現效果量統計結果的報告

25
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.600
you have to report a confidence interval around this effect size estimate.
必須包括估計的信賴區間

26
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.100
We can visualize this.
以這個視覺化範例說明

27
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.980
In this case, we have a correlation.
這個散佈圖已計算出相關係數

28
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.950
And we've plotted the correlation between two variables.
表示兩個變項之間的相關性

29
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.830
In this graph, we've visualize the uncertainty around the correlation between
這圖呈現雙胞胎之間的智商相關程度與不確定性

30
00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.370
made up data of an IQ of one twin, and the IQ of the other twin.
這圖呈現雙胞胎之間的智商相關程度與不確定性

31
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.870
We can see that this IQ score is related.
相關係數表示智商有相關性

32
00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.933
There's a positive correlation of 0.52, but
兩者間有0.52的正相關

33
00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:11.810
of course our correlation is an estimate from a sample.
只是這結果是從部分樣本估計得出

34
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.250
If we want to generalize this to the population,
如果要類推到母群

35
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.970
then there's always some uncertainty and
必須要考慮估計的不確定性

36
00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.620
in this case, the uncertainty is illustrated by the blue area.
也就是圖中藍色區域

37
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.890
The blue area illustrates a 95% confidence interval.
藍色區域表示95%信賴區間

38
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.500
But how should you interpret a 95% confidence interval?
但是要如何去解讀呢？

39
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.050
Confidence intervals are a statement about the percentage of future confidence
信賴區間是一段數值區間
宣告真實參數值存在於區間之內的百分比

40
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.200
intervals that contain the true parameter value.
信賴區間是一段數值區間
宣告真實參數值存在於區間之內的百分比

41
00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.570
Now, this is not very intuitive.
這種宣告並非臆測

42
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.730
You might think that a single confidence interval contains
設想一段信賴區間有95%的機會包含母群參數

43
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.282
the true population parameter, 95% of the time.
設想一段信賴區間有95%的機會包含母群參數

44
00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:49.200
That would make sense and if a non-statistician might come up with
非統計專業人士以信賴區間呈現報告

45
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.430
a confidence interval, the concept of a confidence interval.
都是想要運用這樣的概念

46
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.660
That's probably what we wanted to be.
表達當下研究結果的確定性

47
00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.640
But that's not how they work.
然而實際確非如此

48
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.880
The confidence interval is a frequentist concept.
信賴區間是次數主義的概念

49
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.520
It means that they apply to the long run.
表達一項研究執行重覆執行之後

50
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.640
Now in the long run, 95%
這些結果之中有95%包含真實參數值

51
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.880
of future confidence intervals will contain the true parameter value.
這些結果之中有95%包含真實參數值

52
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.440
So the true effect size, for example, in the population.
就像是母群的真實效果量

53
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.430
Because this is counter-intuitive, let's try to visualize it.
因為很難想像，讓我們看這個視覺化範例

54
00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.325
In this illustration, which we again take from rpsychologist.com, you can see many,
這張圖也是取自rpsychologist.com

55
00:03:25.325 --> 00:03:30.065
many different confidence intervals for the same simulated study.
模擬一項研究重覆數次的信賴區間

56
00:03:30.065 --> 00:03:33.354
We see blue dots, which are the sample estimates,
其中的藍點都是樣本估計值

57
00:03:33.354 --> 00:03:36.734
the effect sizes from the sample that we collected.
表示樣本估計的效果果量

58
00:03:36.734 --> 00:03:41.240
And the black line is the 95% confidence interval.
每點黑線都是95%信賴區間

59
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:46.420
Now most of the black lines contain the true sample mean.
大部分的黑線都包含真實的平均值

60
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.530
In this case, the true sample mean is zero.
這個例子的真實平均值是0

61
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.560
And we see that most of the black lines touch upon zero.
大部分黑線都與標記0的垂直線相交

62
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.340
Sometimes they don't.
只有少數沒有

63
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.400
We calculate it at 95% confidence interval.
之所以稱為95%信賴區間

64
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.030
So 5% of the time in the long run, we
是因為其中5%的模擬結果信賴區間並未
包合真實參數值

65
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.410
will get a confidence interval that does not contain the true population parameter.
是因為其中5%的模擬結果信賴區間並未
包合真實參數值

66
00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:11.370
These are illustrated by the black arrows and they are visualized by red lines.
圖中黑色箭頭與紅線就是未包含的模擬結果

67
00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.550
So the red lines do not contain the true population parameter.
我們可以計算紅線的數量比例

68
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.983
And this will happen in the long run, approximately 5% of the time.
得知重覆執行之後，有5%的結果不包含真實參數值

69
00:04:18.983 --> 00:04:23.926
Now it's also clear that randomly chosen single confidence interval here does
這也說明為何隨機獲得一種結果

70
00:04:23.926 --> 00:04:27.847
not contain the true population parameter 95% of the time.
並不是指這道信賴區間有95%的機會包含真實參數值

71
00:04:27.847 --> 00:04:30.663
And in the assignment, we'll focus a little bit more on this.
本週作業裡，你將更深入探討其中原理

72
00:04:32.795 --> 00:04:34.183
So 95% of future,
了解為何95%

73
00:04:34.183 --> 00:04:40.450
95% confidence intervals will contain the true population parameter in the long run.
是指所有再現結果中的95%包含真實參數值

74
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.599
Never forget that this is a frequentist concept.
請記住這是次數主義的概念

75
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.570
A single confidence interval after you've collected the data,
一次研究結果的信賴區間

76
00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.210
either contains the true population parameter or it does not.
可能會，也可能不會包含真實參數值

77
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:55.740
So in this case, you either have it or you don't, but you never know which it is.
只看一次結果，永遠不可能知道有沒有包含

78
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.780
But in the long run, you can say that 95% of
只有重覆再現數次

79
00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.339
confidence intervals will contain the true population parameter.
才能歸納其中95%包括的數值是真實參數值

80
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:08.280
You can calculate the confidence interval around almost any estimate.
任何統計估計值都可以計算信賴區間

81
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.000
But most commonly, we calculate confidence intervals around means or
只是比較常見的是平均值、平均值差異

82
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.110
mean differences or effect sizes.
還有效果量的信賴區間

83
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.350
And it's very recommended to report them around effect sizes if you report effect
如果研究報告經常呈現效果量

84
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.810
sizes, which you should always do.
最好一併呈現信賴區間

85
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.970
So how do you calculate a 95% confidence interval or
那要如何計算95%的信賴區間呢？

86
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:28.167
different size confidence interval?
那要如何計算95%的信賴區間呢？

87
00:05:28.167 --> 00:05:30.931
Again, there's nothing magical about 95%.
方法一樣非常簡單

88
00:05:30.931 --> 00:05:35.034
You can calculate a 90% confidence interval or a 99% confidence interval,
可以的話
你也能計算90%或99%的信賴區間

89
00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:35.826
if you want to.
可以的話
你也能計算90%或99%的信賴區間

90
00:05:35.826 --> 00:05:40.920
For the 95% confidence interval around the mean,
以平均值的95%信賴區間來說

91
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.960
you calculate it by taking the mean and then adding or
只要把平均值加上還有減去

92
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.200
subtracting the critical Zed value multiplied by the standard error.
臨界的Z值與標準誤的乘積

93
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:54.070
Now, it's okay if you don't immediately remember what the standard error is.
沒辦法立刻想起標準誤怎麼算也OK

94
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.780
The standard error is the standard deviation divided by the square root of N,
標準誤就是標準差除以N的開根號

95
00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.970
and N is the sample size.
N就是樣本數

96
00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.600
So you can see that the larger the sample that we get,
因此樣本數越大

97
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.820
the smaller the standard error.
標準誤就越小

98
00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.752
And as a consequence, the smaller the confidence interval.
得到的信賴區間也會越小

99
00:06:10.752 --> 00:06:15.078
If you want to calculate a 95% confidence interval around a mean then,
如果要計算的是平均值的95%信賴區間

100
00:06:15.078 --> 00:06:20.270
based on the normal distribution, you would multiply the standard error by 1.96.
是根據常態分配，只要將標準誤乘以1.96

101
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.060
This is a value that you see quite often in calculating confidence intervals.
1.96在信賴區間的計算非常常見

102
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.880
It's good to know that this is just the critical Zed value for a two-sided test.
因為1.96是雙側檢定的臨界Z值

103
00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.842
So you're very often see this 1.96 value when people calculate confidence
所以常用的人對這數值相當熟悉

104
00:06:32.842 --> 00:06:33.500
intervals.
所以常用的人對這數值相當熟悉

105
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.930
So as the sample size increases, confidence intervals become more narrow.
那麼樣本數增加，信賴區間越小是怎麼回事

106
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:41.990
Let's visualize this.
我們來看這個視覺化範例

107
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:50.050
In this graph, we can see an increasing sample size in the horizontal axis.
這張圖的橫軸是樣本數，最多是500

108
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:57.520
It goes to 100, 200, 300, 400 participants in a two-sided D test.
設定進行每個指定人數的t檢定模擬

109
00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.730
On the vertical axis, we've plotted the effects size, and
垂直軸是效果量

110
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.890
in this simulation there's no true effect.
模擬沒有真實效果的實驗

111
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:07.389
In other words, the effects size is zero and
所以效果量為0時

112
00:07:07.389 --> 00:07:12.978
we see that the effect size estimate varies around this value of zero.
實驗結果的估計值在0的上下擺盪

113
00:07:12.978 --> 00:07:17.556
The dotted lines are the 95% confidence interval.
虛線正是95%信賴區間的邊界

114
00:07:17.556 --> 00:07:20.606
And we see that as the sample size increases,
隨著樣本數增加

115
00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:24.310
the 95% confidence interval becomes more narrow.
95%信賴區間逐漸縮短

116
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.320
In this simulation,
在這個模擬範例

117
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:32.228
the effect size actually stays very nicely between the 95% confidence interval.
模擬出來的效果量都在95%信賴區間之內

118
00:07:32.228 --> 00:07:37.360
But sometimes, 5% of the time, the simulation will give you
然而大約有5%的模擬結果會超過這個範圍

119
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:43.150
an effect size measure that falls just outside of these 95% confidence borders.
然而大約有5%的模擬結果會超過這個範圍

120
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:47.600
Now it's very important not to incorrectly interpret the confidence interval.
誤讀信賴區間的意義是很嚴重的

121
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.490
And regrettably, the most intuitive interpretation is incorrect.
可惜的是，許多書藉文章的解讀是錯誤的

122
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:57.295
You might feel that if you have a single 95% confidence interval.
有人認為根據一次結果95%的信賴區間

123
00:07:57.295 --> 00:08:02.850
Then 95% of future estimates will fall within this single confidence interval.
未來相同的實驗，
有95%的結果就會是區間之內

124
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:07.440
But a confidence interval is a statement about future confidence intervals.
然而信賴區間只是宣告未來可能得到的信賴區間

125
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.590
It's not a statement about future estimates.
而非宣告可能得到的估計值

126
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:15.130
It says that 95% of future confidence intervals will contain the true
它只表示將產出的信賴區間有95%包含母群參數值

127
00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:16.370
population parameter.
它只表示將產出的信賴區間有95%包含母群參數值

128
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:21.973
You can take a look at how often a single 95% confidence
也可以從另一個角度看單一的95%信賴區間

129
00:08:21.973 --> 00:08:26.185
interval will contain the true population parameter.
會包含真實母群參數的機會

130
00:08:26.185 --> 00:08:31.547
Simulation studies have shown that if you perform many, many, many simulations.
以此設定做了非常非常多次的模擬結果

131
00:08:31.547 --> 00:08:37.420
Then, it turns out that about 84.3% of single 95% confidence
會發現84.3%的模擬結果

132
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:42.608
intervals contain the population parameter in the long run.
顯示單一95%信賴區間包含母群參數

133
00:08:42.608 --> 00:08:45.520
And this is known as a capture percentage.
84.3%被稱為佔有百分比(capture percentage)

134
00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.700
So a single 95% confidence interval will capture the true value, 84.3% of the time.
也就是用單一信賴區間預測未來的再現結果
有84.3%的正確率

135
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:55.471
Regrettably, this varies quite a lot, it depends,
很可惜，這個數值是變動的

136
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:57.821
you never really know whether this is the case or not.
另一個研究的佔有百分比可能不是84.3%

137
00:08:57.821 --> 00:09:02.546
So this is not a very usable statistic in itself, but a least it's one way to
所以信賴區間並非可靠的統計值

138
00:09:02.546 --> 00:09:07.871
interpret the single 95% confidence before it gives you some idea about how often
但至少可以推測有多少實驗結果會包含真實母群參數

139
00:09:07.871 --> 00:09:13.610
this single confidence interval will contain the true population parameter.
但至少可以推測有多少實驗結果會包含真實母群參數

140
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:17.050
About five in six times, it will be the case.
也許六個裡頭有五個會包含

141
00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.460
You never really know for a single observation.
但是只憑一個結果沒人能推測

142
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.750
Now confidence intervals and p-values are directly related.
信賴區間與p值密不可分

143
00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:30.297
If a single 95% confidence interval does not contain zero,
一個95%信賴區間不包含0

144
00:09:30.297 --> 00:09:35.490
it automatically implies that the p-value is smaller than 0.05.
相當於p值小於0.05

145
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.000
Let's take a look at a meta analysis where we've plotted effect sizes and
讓我們看一下這則整合分析的視覺範例

146
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.819
confidence intervals, so we can visualize this.
讓我們看一下這則整合分析的視覺範例

147
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.827
In this graph, we see what's know as a four split.
圖中最上面有四條黑條

148
00:09:47.827 --> 00:09:51.558
Every line illustrates a single study.
分別代表單一研究結果

149
00:09:51.558 --> 00:09:55.100
On the horizontal axis, we see the effects size Hedges' G.
水平線的效果量表示Hedges' g

150
00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.420
The four studies vary in the effect size, illustrated by the yellow square.
四個研究的效果量以黃色方塊表示

151
00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.994
Around an effect size of 0.43.
整合效果量大約是0.43

152
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.140
Each effect size has a 95% confidence interval,
每個研究結果效果量有95%信賴區間

153
00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.640
visualized by the black horizontal line.
正是每條黑色水平線的範圍

154
00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:19.642
If we take a look at the third study from the top, we can see that a 95%
仔細看會發現從最上頭算起第三個研究

155
00:10:19.642 --> 00:10:25.793
confidence interval overlaps with the black vertical line at Hedges' G of zero.
信賴區間包含Hedges' g為0

156
00:10:25.793 --> 00:10:30.751
This implies that the third study did not yield the statistically significant
這表示第三個研究結果是不顯著的

157
00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:31.359
effect.
這表示第三個研究結果是不顯著的

158
00:10:31.359 --> 00:10:37.240
Because the 95% confidence interval around the effect size estimates contains zero.
因為這項效果量的信賴區間包含0

159
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.730
Now, we've been talking about confidence intervals from a frequentist perspective.
至此已說完信賴區間的次數主義觀點

160
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.530
And here we have the slightly counter-intuitive interpretation
解釋為何多次研究的信賴區間

161
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.050
of confidence intervals in the long run.
與一般人的直覺是相反的

162
00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:55.365
So 95% confidence intervals will contain the true population parameter,
次數主義的解讀是所有研究結果信賴區間
會有95%包含真實母群參數

163
00:10:55.365 --> 00:10:59.320
95% of the time in the long run, which is a frequentist interpretation.
次數主義的解讀是所有研究結果信賴區間
會有95%包含真實母群參數

164
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.980
A more intuitive interpretation is found in Bayesian statistics where people
符合一般人直覺的是貝氏統計的可信區間

165
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:07.130
calculate credible intervals.
符合一般人直覺的是貝氏統計的可信區間

166
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:12.150
Or a slightly different version known as in highest density interval, and
也有人稱呼最大密度區間

167
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:15.742
these can be interpreted in a more strait forward manner.
可信區間的解讀方式比信賴區間更直接

168
00:11:15.742 --> 00:11:21.490
A 95% credible interval contains all of the values that you find most plausible.
95%可信區間包含的值都有可能是母群參數

169
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.720
In this case, you are quantifying your belief.
95%是宣告者個人信心的量化

170
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.100
It doesn't mean that 95% of the true population parameters indeed
並不是說真實母群參數有95%的機率落在這區間

171
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.820
fall within this area.
並不是說真實母群參數有95%的機率落在這區間

172
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.570
It doesn't mean that in the long run,
也不是指再做幾次相同研究

173
00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:38.200
you can expect 95% of credible intervals to contain the true population parameter.
可能有95%的結果可信區間包含真實母群參數

174
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.990
But it quantifies your belief, these are the values that you find most plausible.
這個區間表示依照研究者的方法，
最可能找到參數的範圍

175
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.810
Remember that earlier, we visualized the distributions of the prior,
第一週課程曾介紹先驗機率分配

176
00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.860
in this case, the gray line.
也就是這張圖的灰色曲線

177
00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:54.980
The blue dashed line, illustrating the likelihood function which together,
藍色虛線是似然性函數的分配

178
00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.159
create the posterior distribution illustrated by the black line.
有前兩者才能知道黑色曲線代表的事後機率分配

179
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.520
We can calculate the 95% credible interval,
而95%可信區間就是

180
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:05.940
the values that lie between the two shaded areas in the tails.
黑色曲線下沒有著色的區域

181
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.290
Confidence intervals provide some idea of what will happen in the future.
信賴區間指引之後研究的可能結果

182
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:15.216
You can use confidence intervals to quantify the uncertainty in your
可用來表示估計值不確定的部分

183
00:12:15.216 --> 00:12:15.966
estimates.
可用來表示估計值不確定的部分

184
00:12:15.966 --> 00:12:19.020
Whenever you report important parameter estimates,
只要報告重要的參數估計值

185
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:23.876
such as effect sizes, you should always accompany these with confidence intervals.
像是效果量，務必一起呈現信賴區間

186
00:12:23.876 --> 00:12:28.589
