P-Curve

2
00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:11.763
In this lecture we'll talk about P-curve Analysis.
這一講介紹P-Curve分析

3
00:00:11.763 --> 00:00:17.112
A recently developed math analytical tool that allows you to judge
這是最近發展出來，
用來評估一系列文獻證據力的工具

4
00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:22.568
the evidential value is sets of study in the published literature.
這是最近發展出來，
用來評估一系列文獻證據力的工具

5
00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:27.550
What do p-values look like from 100 studies where there is no true effect?
第三週曾預告一百項沒有真實效果的研究結果
用P-Curve分析的模樣

6
00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.820
We've discussed this in an earlier lecture.
第三週曾預告一百項沒有真實效果的研究結果
用P-Curve分析的模樣

7
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.875
If you remember correctly,
你還記得的話

8
00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:37.040
p-values are uniformly distributed if there's no true effect.
那些研究的p值是均勻分佈

9
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.070
Now if you've watched enough medical series,
如果你看過大量醫學文獻

10
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.430
you know that the flat line is no good news, right?
就會知道平坦的曲線不是好事

11
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.140
So in this case, if we see a p-value distribution,
一系列文獻的p值分佈呈現均勻分配的話
表示沒什麼值得探討的東西

12
00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.638
that's uniformly distributed then nothing is going on.
一系列文獻的p值分佈呈現均勻分配的話
表示沒什麼值得探討的東西

13
00:00:48.638 --> 00:00:53.140
What do p-values look like from 100 studies where there is a true effect?
那麼100項沒有真實效果的研究結果p值分佈是什麼樣子？

14
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.170
Well in this case we know that the p-value distribution depends on the statistical
我們已經知道p值分佈與統計檢定力有關

15
00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.100
power of the test.
我們已經知道p值分佈與統計檢定力有關

16
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.197
In general we can expect more low p-values around 0.01 for
一般而言，文獻中最常看到的p值是.01到.05之間

17
00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:08.863
example then high p-values around 0.05.
一般而言，文獻中最常看到的p值是.01到.05之間

18
00:01:08.863 --> 00:01:13.398
Even though all these p-values are statistically significant, they're all
即使所有p值都指出統計顯著的結果

19
00:01:13.398 --> 00:01:18.470
smaller than 0.05 they're not all equally likely if there is a true effect.
小於.05也不能保證確實有效果存在

20
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.383
We should find low p-values more
often than relatively high p-values.
除非偏低的p值數量多於偏高的p值

21
00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:27.191
P-curve analysis allows you to test whether a set of p-values has
P-Curve分析能檢驗一系列p值的證據力

22
00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:29.270
evidential value.
P-Curve分析能檢驗一系列p值的證據力

23
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.978
In this case evidential value is defined as does the p-value distribution
那麼證據力應該是指沒有真實效果時，
p值分佈近似均勻分配

24
00:01:33.978 --> 00:01:38.684
look more like a uniform distribution, where there's no true effect, or
那麼證據力應該是指沒有真實效果時，
p值分佈近似均勻分配？

25
00:01:38.684 --> 00:01:42.737
more like a p-value distribution where these is a true effect?
還是有真實效果時，p值分佈近似均勻分配？

26
00:01:42.737 --> 00:01:48.820
An important benefit of P-curve analysis is that it's a key to the file-drawer.
P-curve最吸引人的特點是能評估抽屜效應

27
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.920
The test is only performed on p values smaller than 0.05.
就算分析內容只有小於0.05的p值

28
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.170
Given publication bias,
因為出版偏誤的緣故

29
00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.120
where we know studies are much more likely to be published when they
統計顯著的研究比統計不顯著的研究更容易被發表

30
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.620
are statistically significant, than when they are not statistically significant.
統計顯著的研究比統計不顯著的研究更容易被發表

31
00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.380
An important benefit of P-Curve analysis is that you only need
P-Curve分析的優點是就算資料都是統計顯著的

32
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.280
the statistically significant study results to perform the test.
P-Curve分析的優點是就算資料都是統計顯著的

33
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.800
So you can perform it even though there is publication bias and
也能讓文獻的出版偏誤現形

34
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.180
that's a huge important benefit.
這是P-Curve引起注意的一大亮點

35
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.250
Another useful thing about P-curve analysis is that you can
P-Curve分析的另一個好處是不需要安裝統計軟體

36
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.900
perform the test online, you don't need any statistical software.
到官網輸入資料就能完成

37
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.710
Go to the online test, enter test statistics and
在網頁中輸入要分析的檢定方法

38
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.790
perform all the required calculations.
還有必要的統計數值就好

39
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.420
The question we're trying to address with a p-curve analysis is
P-Curve分析回答的首要問題是

40
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.900
does the p-value distribution look like one with, or one without a true effect.
有真實效果和沒有真實效果的p值分佈
看起來會不會一樣？

41
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.620
A good moment to perform a p-curve analysis is before you set out
最好的檢驗方法是拿設計研究的參考文獻試試看

42
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.650
to build on studies in the published literature.
最好的檢驗方法是拿設計研究的參考文獻試試看

43
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.800
You might want to know whether this studies in the public
可以先了解這些文獻能被發表出來

44
00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.980
literature are just there due to publication bias, and
是因為出版偏誤

45
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.720
they are all basically type one errors, there's no true effect.
還是被型一錯誤膨脹出來的虛假效應

46
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.730
Or whether the results look robust enough to build on.
也可以檢討這些研究結果夠不夠穩定

47
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.870
So we're trying to differentiate between these two possible p-value distributions,
了解P-Curve分析結果的首要功課是區辨兩種p值分佈

48
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.860
uniform or what's known as ride scheme.
均勻分佈和正偏態分佈

49
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.530
The green line in this case illustrates a true effect.
綠線是有真實效果的P-Curve

50
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.920
Now let's take a look at an example.
我們用這個實例進一步說明

51
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.700
I perform the p-curve analyze of two related lines of research.
下一張展示兩個項研究的P-Curve

52
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.880
On the one hand elderly priming studies and
一項是"老年印象"促發

53
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.870
on the other hand professor priming studies.
另一項是“教授印象”促發

54
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.930
Now the evidence in these studies was debated
這兩項研究過去一直存在難以再現的爭議

55
00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.690
by the publication of field replication studies.
這兩項研究過去一直存在難以再現的爭議

56
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.170
Some people responded to these field replications by indicating that there
原研究者對再現不易的回應是

57
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.969
are many, many different studies in the literature that show related effects.
已經存在許多類似效果且正面支持的文獻

58
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.220
Now this is a valid reply, except that if you want to say that there's evidence
雖然這樣的回應有理，但是要檢視相關文獻證據力

59
00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.290
in the published literature, then you need to quantify this.
最好能呈現數據說明

60
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.260
You can do this either by performing traditional data analysis or
可以用傳統的資料分析方法

61
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.880
you can perform a p-curve analysis and that's what I did in this case.
或者用這一講介紹的P-Curve

62
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.215
Now this is the P-Curve analysis for
Elderly Priming Studies.
黑色實線是"老年印象"促發的P-Curve

63
00:04:06.215 --> 00:04:10.470
ElderyPpriming examines the idea that if you expose most people to elderly related
"老年印象"促發是讓參與者持續看有關老年的字詞

64
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:16.270
words, such as engl, grey or Florida, this will influence their behavior.
像是"灰頭髮"和“佛羅里達州”
行為就會被影響

65
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:19.270
More specifically, it will influence their walking speed.
特別之處是參與者的走路速度會變慢

66
00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.750
The idea being that elderly people walk more slowly.
符合老年人走路慢的想法

67
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.320
So, people who were primed with elderly related words
這系列的原始研究發現讀老年相關字詞的參與者

68
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.200
would walk more slowly to an elevator than people in the control condition.
走向出口電梯的速度比控制組慢

69
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.040
If we take a look at the p-value distribution of the studies in
現在來看這一系列研究結果的p值分佈

70
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.838
the literature, we see that the p-value distribution is not uniformly distributed,
這條分佈既不是均勻分配

71
00:04:39.838 --> 00:04:41.870
it's not right-skewed.
也不是正偏態分配

72
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.060
Now, actually, we see that a lot of these P-values are only barely significant.
多數研究結果的p值只是剛好顯著

73
00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:51.240
This is not an indication that the studies published in the literature provide
這一系列研究的結果實際上無法充分支持假設

74
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.530
support for the hypothesis.
這一系列研究的結果實際上無法充分支持假設

75
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.470
The hypothesis might still be true, but the data that we have available
假設或許是對的，但是文獻資料無法說服所有讀者
效應確實存在

76
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.030
does not give us any reason to believe that this is a true effect.
假設或許是對的，但是文獻資料無法說服所有讀者
效應確實存在

77
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.390
Now let's take at look professor priming studies.
接著來看“教授印象”促發的研究

78
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:10.160
In this line of research, people are asked to think about a professor, or
這一系列研究的實驗組參與者要想像自己是一位教授

79
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.860
in the control condition, they're asked to think about a group that's stereotypically
對比控制組的參與者
想像自己是比較不常動腦的樣板人物

80
00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.020
seen as less intelligent such as soccer hooligans.
像是啦啦隊員

81
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.650
The idea in this study is that participants who thought about a professor
原始想法是想像自己是教授的參與者

82
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.510
are more likely to perform better on a general knowledge test,
做常識測驗的表現會比

83
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.830
such as trivial pursuit, than people in the control condition.
控制組的參與者更好

84
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.580
If we look at the P-value distribution, in this case, the distribution is very
這系列研究的p值分佈

85
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.110
similar to that that we would expect when there is a true effect.
非常接近存在真實效應的分配

86
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.160
Now this illustrates how useful it is to perform a p-curve analysis
這兩個例子示範P-Curve如何幫助我們

87
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.450
before you want to build on studies in the published literature.
選擇真正有參考價值的文獻

88
00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.356
Let's say that you're interested in priming effects, would you build on
如果你想設計類似的促發效應研究

89
00:05:52.356 --> 00:05:56.516
elderly priming research, or would you build on professor priming research?
應該參考"老年印象"，還是“教授印象”？

90
00:05:56.516 --> 00:06:01.825
Now, these p-curve analyses do not prove that professor priming is a real effect,
雖然P-Curve不能直接指出“教授印象”有真實效果

91
00:06:01.825 --> 00:06:04.464
and elderly priming is not a real effect.
"老年印象"沒有真實效果

92
00:06:04.464 --> 00:06:08.343
But if you're thinking about doing research on priming, and
如果你想設計促發實驗

93
00:06:08.343 --> 00:06:13.191
you have to decide between these two research areas, then it's a much better
有必要從兩種研究模式選擇一種
而P-Curve可以告訴你

94
00:06:13.191 --> 00:06:18.360
bet to build on professor priming related studies than elderly priming studies.
選"教授印象"的勝算較大

95
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.600
You can also use p-curve analysis for small sets of p-values.
少量的p值也可以用P-Curve分析

96
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.500
You have to take a little care, when you have a small number of observations,
只是要稍微注意一下
資料不多的時候

97
00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.470
you have low statistical power for any test, also for a p-curve analysis.
統計檢定力必定偏低
P-Curve分析也會受限

98
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:38.810
But sometimes, the data is so clear that even with a small set of studies,
不過有時候少量研究的資料非常清楚

99
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.246
you can prevent yourself from following up on reliable research.
可以確保分析的可信度

100
00:06:42.246 --> 00:06:43.982
Let's take an example.
來看看這個實例

101
00:06:43.982 --> 00:06:49.350
In this publication, researchers look at the effect of reading literary fiction.
這篇論文研究閱讀小說的效用

102
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.155
On Theory of Mind, how much do you, for example, empathize with other people?
根據心智理論，研究者想問小說讀者會不會更有同理心

103
00:06:54.155 --> 00:06:57.151
The researchers performed five studies, and
論文作者執行了五項研究

104
00:06:57.151 --> 00:07:02.320
they provided table with a critical test results for each study.
所有結果的分析總結在一張表格裡

105
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.960
We're always interested in the main effect of condition and
因為要探討的是組間的主要效果

106
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:06.810
I've highlighted the test results here.
我把檢定結果標示出來

107
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:12.232
We can see that for the first study they observed a p-value of 0.01.
由上面開始看到第一個研究的p值是0.01

108
00:07:12.232 --> 00:07:16.381
For the second they have observed the p-value of 0.08.
第二個研究的p值是0.08

109
00:07:16.381 --> 00:07:21.205
This test result will be ignored by
the p-curve analysis because it only
由於不小於0.05
這項p值在P-Curve分析裡會被忽略

110
00:07:21.205 --> 00:07:24.299
focuses on p-values smaller than 0.05.
由於不小於0.05
這項p值在P-Curve分析裡會被忽略

111
00:07:24.299 --> 00:07:27.460
Now for the remaining three studies,
其他三個研究的p值

112
00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.118
we see p values of 0.04, 0.04, and 0.04.
分別都是0.04

113
00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:36.680
Let's perform a p-curve analysis on this data set.
來看看P-Curve分析的結果

114
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.250
We can see that the p-value distribution is not
這條P-Curve表示並沒有真實效果存在

115
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:41.270
as you would expect if there is a true effect.
這條P-Curve表示並沒有真實效果存在

116
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:46.790
And indeed the statistical test tells us that the evidential
統計檢定的結果其實指出這些研究的證據力並不充分

117
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.560
value of the set up studies, if any, is inadequate.
統計檢定的結果其實指出這些研究的證據力並不充分

118
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.170
This does not mean that the theory is false and could still be true but
這不是說理論是錯的，而且以後有可能翻盤

119
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.200
the data we have available in this publication
但是這些已發表的資料無法支持研究者的假設

120
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.750
does not allow us to conclude that the hypothesis is supported.
但是這些已發表的資料無法支持研究者的假設

121
00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:05.990
The reason that I'm giving this example is not that I want to point
我拿這篇論文說明，並不是指出

122
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:10.780
out that some people publish set of studies that are not reliable, it happens.
這篇論文的作者研究品質信度不高

123
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.850
This is very important for you to know that you can use p-curve
重點是讓你知道P-Curve可以評估一系列研究結果
的可信程度

124
00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:18.029
analysis to identify sets of studies that are less reliable than others.
重點是讓你知道P-Curve可以評估一系列研究結果
的可信程度

125
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.080
When I was presenting about p-curve analysis in workshop I taught,
在我曾親自主持的工作坊教授P-Curve分析時

126
00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.460
one of the PhD students in the room
當時有位博士生立刻用這篇論文做P-Curve分析

127
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.810
was performing a p-curve analysis on exactly this set of studies.
當時有位博士生立刻用這篇論文做P-Curve分析

128
00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:33.650
This PhD student was trying to replicate these studies for over a year but
這位博士生一直嘗試再現研究結果

129
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.850
had been unsuccessful.
但始終不能成功

130
00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.430
So I think it's very important to perform a p-curve of analysis before you try to
所以P-Curve分析也許是做文獻回顧的好幫手

131
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:41.430
build on studies in the literature.
所以P-Curve分析也許是做文獻回顧的好幫手

132
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.510
Because otherwise you might waste a year trying to build on research that is not as
也許能幫你省下投入低信度研究的時間

133
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.550
reliable as you think.
也許能幫你省下投入低信度研究的時間

134
00:08:48.005 --> 00:08:51.820
Now remember when a p-curve analysis says that
請記得即使P-Curve分析指出一系列研究

135
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:56.140
a set of study lacks evidential value, the theory might still be true.
缺乏證據力，研究背後的理論還有可能是真的

136
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.279
The data just don't provide evidence for the theory.
資料無法做理論的直接證據

137
00:09:00.905 --> 00:09:04.700
P-curve analysis allows you to test whether a set of studies in the published
P-Curve分析可以檢測一系列文獻的p值

138
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.660
literature yields a p-value distribution that looks more like the one you
到底接近存在真實效果，還是沒有真實效果

139
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:12.020
would expect when there is a true effect, than when there is no true effect.
到底接近存在真實效果，還是沒有真實效果

140
00:09:13.162 --> 00:09:17.518
Using p-curve analysis before you decide to build on studies on the published
閱讀設計研究有關的文獻時

141
00:09:17.518 --> 00:09:21.157
literature might allow you to see how robust these findings are.
P-Curve分析可以評估結果的穩定度

142
00:09:21.157 --> 00:09:24.658
And prevents you from building an unreliable results.
避免製造低信度的結果
