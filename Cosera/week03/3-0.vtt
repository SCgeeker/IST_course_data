[訪問丹尼爾.賽門斯]      
      
2      
00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:12.787    
So we're here in the office with Dan    
Simons, someone you might have heard of  
今天我們訪問丹尼爾.西蒙斯(Dan Simons)  
  
3  
00:00:12.787 --> 00:00:16.876  
because in many introduction to psychology  
lectures there's this video of a gorilla  
你應該在心理學課程中看過有隻大猩猩在一群人中遊走，
卻沒有人發現的影片  
  
4  
00:00:16.876 --> 00:00:21.230  
walking through a group of people and  
people don't notice this gorilla.  
你應該在心理學課程中看過有隻大猩猩在一群人中遊走，
卻沒有人發現的影片  
  
5  
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.740  
You might have even read this book and  
也許你已經讀過他寫的科普書<為什麼你沒看見大猩猩？>
(The Invisible Gorilla)  
  
6  
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.010  
if you haven't then I  
highly recommend you do.  
沒有的話，強烈建議你找來看看  
  
7  
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.300  
Where he describes this type of research.  
書中描述相當多類似的研究  
  
8  
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.790  
But this is not what I'm going to talk  
about today because then Simons is also,  
不過這並不是我們今天要討論的主題  
  
9  
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.530  
together with Alex Holcomb and  
丹尼爾.西蒙斯與Alex Holcomb  
  
10  
00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.830  
Jennifer Tackett, an editor at  
Perspectives on Psychological Science.  
以及Perspective of Psychological Science的編輯Jennifer Tackett  
  
11  
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.370  
Where they have this new article format.  
一起架構「註冊再現研究」的發表格式  
  
12  
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.230  
So Dan, there's this new type  
of research just published it's  
那麼，丹，我們來談談什麼是「註冊再現研究」  
  
13  
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.790  
known as a registered replication report.  
那麼，丹，我們來談談什麼是「註冊再現研究」  
  
14  
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.450  
Yes.  
好的  
  
15  
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.650  
And people do research but  
這種發表方式和一般科學論文發表的方式有點不同    
  
16  
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.810  
it's a little bit different  
than a normal journal paper.  
這種發表方式和一般科學論文發表的方式有點不同    
  
17  
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.330  
Yeah, it's very much different  
than a normal journal article.  
是的，這與一般的期刊論文相當不同  
  
18  
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.320  
So, in a normal journal article  
people will run their one or  
一般的論文發表，研究者通常做一個  
  
19  
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.390  
two studies or three studies,  
they'll compile them into a package and  
到三個研究，再統整結果  
  
20  
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.740  
then they'll submit that as a publication.  
投稿到期刊發表  
  
21  
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.780  
What a register replication report is  
designed to do is to estimate the size and  
「註冊再現研究」的設計著重估計重要發現的效果量，穩健度，信度，以及一致性  
  
22  
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.160  
the robustness and reliability and  
consistency of an important finding.  
「註冊再現研究」的設計著重估計重要發現的效果量，穩健度，信度，以及一致性  
  
23  
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.030  
So what we do is we  
find a finding that all  
所以我們選出一些已經公開發表的研究  
  
24  
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:17.430  
ready been published in the Literature.  
所以我們選出一些已經公開發表的研究  
  
25  
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.450  
One that has been cited many times or  
而這些研究都已經被其他文獻大量引用  
  
26  
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.330  
talked about in the media that is really  
influential in the field or in the public,  
或是在媒體上被大量的討論，且對該領域有著相當程度的影響  
  
27  
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.760  
and we design a protocol to  
directly replicate that study.  
我們設計一種直接複製該項研究協定範本  
  
28  
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.090  
So to do the same thing again.  
也就是再做一次原始研究的細節  
  
29  
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.880  
And we take that design, build out  
the protocol, write out the scripts.  
我們根據原始研究擬定協定，編撰程序腳本  
  
30  
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.650  
And then we put out a call for other labs  
that want to join in this project, and  
然後廣邀有興趣的實驗室參加這個專案  
  
31  
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.730  
they each will then replicate the original  
study using exactly the same protocol.  
所有參加的實驗室根據協定再現原始研究  
  
32  
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.550  
So we have anywhere from 10 to 30 labs  
一個專案可能會有10到30個實驗室參與  
  
33  
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.740  
conducting the same study in the same way  
across the wide range of cultures and  
在不同的文化與受試者母群  
  
34  
00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.090  
across the wide range  
of subject populations.  
用同樣的方式複製原始研究的細節  
  
35  
00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.310  
What that allows to do is to say,  
how consistent to this effect?  
這樣的方式可以評估原始實驗效果的一致性  
  
36  
00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.970  
We basically combine all the results in  
a meta analysis that allows us to say,  
我們使用整合分析(meta analysis)分析所有實驗室的結果  
  
37  
00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.470  
what's the overall average effect for  
this original study,  
估計原始研究的整體平均效果量  
  
38  
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.820  
and how variable is it  
across all of these labs.  
以及參與實驗室之間的變異  
  
39  
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.840  
So it sounds like the article's  
almost already written  
這麼聽起來，好像是論文一開始就已經寫好了  
  
40  
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.100  
with this protocol perspective,  
there's already a lot of stuff.  
以研究設計協定的部分來說  
該有的都已經有了  
  
41  
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.360  
And then you just go and collect the data?  
而你們只是去取得更多的實驗數據?  
  
42  
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.990  
Essentially, yeah.  
基本上沒錯  
  
43  
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.590  
So, when we design this, we have the study  
already designed, we can, in principle,  
當我們設計時，因為我們已經有原始研究的設計  
可以把整份論文手稿先寫好  
  
44  
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.280  
write the entire manuscript in advance  
because we know what the theory is,  
因為我們已經知道理論是什麼  
  
45  
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.900  
we know what the history is,  
we know what the methods are.  
知道研究的背景  
也知道研究方法  
  
46  
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.230  
We build out these methods, labs go and  
conduct the study themselves, and  
我們規劃好研究方法後  
所有參與的實驗室就各自去做實驗  
  
47  
00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.580  
then they report the results  
in a standardized way.  
然後再以統一的形式撰寫結果報告  
  
48  
00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.870  
Okay, so why is it actually important  
to publish this new type of article?  
好的  
那來談談這種新型態的研究論文的重要性吧  
  
49  
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.390  
Well, one of the critical aspects of  
this sort of registered replication report  
最重要一點是，「註冊再現研究」可以提供傳統研究論文無法提供的訊息  
  
50  
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.710  
is, it does something that no  
other kind of article can do.  
最重要一點是，「註冊再現研究」可以提供傳統研究論文無法提供的訊息   
51  
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:00.230  
So lots of study have been published  
that are then replicated by one lab  
即使一間實驗室自行再現一種已被發表的實驗效果  
  
52  
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.760  
in a single study, but  
any one study can't really be definitive.  
依然還不能確定這種效果真實存在  
  
53  
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.690  
Any one study, unless it's amazingly  
large, one study's almost never  
除非一種研究收集成千上萬的資料  
  
54  
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.830  
compelling evidence that withstand  
all possible forms of variability,  
足以涵蓋所有可能的變異性及取樣誤差

55  
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.368  
all sorts of problems of a sampling error.  
否則無法成為足以令人信服的證據  
  
56  
00:03:19.368 --> 00:03:23.200  
So what this approach does is gives you  
所以，註冊再現研究  
  
57  
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.220  
an unbiased estimate of  
how big the effect is.  
可以得到無偏誤(unbiased)的實驗效果量估計值  

58  
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.790  
And we only will do this for  
而我們只針對那些  
  
59  
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.950  
studies that have some doubt  
about how strong the effect is.  
實驗效果有存疑的研究進行複製實驗  
  
60  
00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.570  
Not that we expect them to not be there,  
but there's only been one study, or  
並不是因為我們不相信它  
而是如果只有單一的實驗結果  
  
61  
00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.360  
it hasn't been directly replicated many  
times, or there are a whole bunch of  
或是那項實驗從沒有被複製過  
  
62  
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.200  
related studies that use different  
methods that suggested more things.  
甚至可能一系列有相關，卻使用不同實驗方式的研究  
進而出現更多不同的結論  
  
63  
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.370  
But because only positive results  
tend to get published in literature,  
可是，因為通常只有顯著結果才被發表  
  
64  
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.740  
we just don't know how reliable  
these sorts of effects are.  
我們很難去了解這些效應的信度  
  
65  
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.520  
Many of the originals were done with  
fairly small samples, which means we,  
由於很多研究往往只取了一小群樣本  
  
66  
00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.050  
again, don't have a great idea of how  
consistent and how big these effects are.  
這代表我們也很難去了解該效應的一致性及效果量  
  
67  
00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.460  
So that's the broad goal.  
這就是推出「註冊再現研究」的目的  
  
68  
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.970  
It does something that no other  
method can do as robustly.  
這種研究結果可以達到傳統研究無法達到的穩健度  
  
69  
00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.140  
Lots of replications are great, and  
single replications are really useful,  
無論是大量或單一實驗都可以用這種方式再現  
  
70  
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.730  
they provide more information.  
可以提供更多傳統研究無法提供的訊息  
  
71  
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.010  
This provides a lot more consistent  
information using a vetted,  
註冊再現研究依經過審定的協定進行實驗  
  
72  
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.790  
evaluated protocol to make  
sure we get it right.  
能用具一致性的訊息審視實驗結果的正確性  
  
73  
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.240  
And of course it's certain  
it will appear in print.  
當然，所有實驗室的結果都會被發表  
  
74  
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.190  
Exactly so  
的確  
  
75  
00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.765  
the results of every one of these studies  
are combined regardless of the outcome.  
無論結果顯不顯著，所有的實驗結果都會被整合    
  
76  
00:04:24.765 --> 00:04:28.475  
And they all get included in the paper,  
so there's no publication bias,  
並一起放進論文裡發表  
所以不會有出版偏誤的問題  
  
77  
00:04:28.475 --> 00:04:30.955  
we don't have only the positive  
results appearing.  
我們不會總只有顯著結果  
  
78  
00:04:30.955 --> 00:04:34.605  
We have all results from all of  
the studies and all of the participants  
我們的結果來自所有參與實驗室的成員  
  
79  
00:04:34.605 --> 00:04:37.785  
in a single paper, and all of  
the participants are authors on the paper.  
全部都放在同一篇期刊論文裡發表  
所有參與的實驗室成員都是論文作者  
  
80  
00:04:37.785 --> 00:04:40.355  
So what inspired you to become an editor and  
那麼你一開始為什麼會想擔任編輯  
  
81  
00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:42.115  
to publish this type of article?  
發表這類型的研究論文呢?  
  
82  
00:04:43.265 --> 00:04:44.915  
The idea for this sort of article  
發表這類型論文的想法起源於  
  
83  
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.720  
was something that my colleague Alex  
Holton and I talked about many years ago.  
多年前我與同事 Alex Holton 的談話  
  
84  
00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.480  
So in psychology there were a state  
of prominent cases of fraud,  
心理學領域裡有很多著名的學術醜聞  
  
85  
00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.220  
and that's not really directly  
relevant here, the replication or  
當然這與今天討論的無法再現實驗結果無關  
  
86  
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.370  
failure to replicate a study doesn't  
have anything to do with fraud.  
當然這與今天討論的無法再現實驗結果無關  
  
87  
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.810  
But the combination of those  
high profile fraud cases coupled  
但是把那些著名的學術醜聞  
  
88  
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.850  
with the failure to replicate some fairly  
prominent findings in the literature,  
和知名卻無法被成功再現的研究結果放在一起來看  
  
89  
00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:15.990  
as well as a bunch of findings  
appearing in the literature that  
還有那些「震驚全球心理學界」的實驗結果  
  
90  
00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.370  
lots of people would look at them say,  
that just can't be.  
還有那些「震驚全球心理學界」的實驗結果  
  
91  
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.280  
So we saw this as an issue of incentives.  
我們覺得這是個該被解決的問題  
  
92  
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.580  
There's a really strong incentive  
to publish new novel findings, and  
發表全新的實驗結果對研究者的吸引力    
  
93  
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.660  
not as much of an incentive to make sure  
that these novel findings are robust or  
遠大於確定這種實驗結果的穩健度或測量的準確性    
  
94  
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.100  
to measure them precisely.  
遠大於確定這種實驗結果的穩健度或測量的準確性    
  
95  
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.100  
Those incentives were lacking in the field  
and one of the things we wanted to do  
這些工作在心理學領域是沒人想做的  
卻是我們要去做的  
  
96  
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.890  
was to say, hey let's take these findings  
that people are using in their research,  
我們針對那些常被人拿來持續研究的實驗結果  
  
97  
00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.210  
that they're using to build theories,  
that they're using to make public policy,  
或是被架構新理論，或影響公共政策的實驗結果  
  
98  
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.350  
let's take a look at these findings and  
say, are they robust?  
召集研究者仔細檢視這些發現的穩健度  
  
99  
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.590  
And we really hope they are, but  
they just hadn't been tested.  
當然，我們希望已發表的研究都是穩健的結果  
只是從來沒有人去測試這些結果的穩健度  
  
100  
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.745  
So it was a need in the field.  
斦以需要我們挺身而出  
  
101  
00:05:54.745 --> 00:05:56.340  
Okay, excellent.  
非常好  
  
102  
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:57.168  
Thank you very much.  
謝謝你  
  
103  
00:05:57.168 --> 00:06:01.809
