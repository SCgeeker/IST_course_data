Professor Dan Simons is well known from his research on change blindness (he co-authored the book '[The Invisible Gorilla](http://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/)' with Christopher Chabris) but in this interview, I talk to Professor Simons about his work as an editor for a new type of research article published in Perspectives on Psychological Science: the [Registered Replication Report](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/replication). Professor Simons discusses the problems with publication bias, low powered studies, and how replication studies are not incentivized in science. we talk about how Registered Replication Report provide a way to gain robust knowledge about specific published findings.
