預先註冊

2
00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:10.577
In the previous lectures,
前面的課程中

3
00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:14.124
we've talked about the importance of controlling your type I error rate.
談到控制型一錯誤率的重要性

4
00:00:14.124 --> 00:00:18.674
An increasingly popular way to make sure that people adequately control their type
目前能適當控制型一錯誤率的方式是預先註冊

5
00:00:18.674 --> 00:00:20.755
I error rates is pre-registration,
目前能適當控制型一錯誤率的方式是預先註冊

6
00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:24.601
where you specify what you're going to do before you perform the study.
這是由研究者自已開始研究前先備份研究計畫

7
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:27.834
And then after, when you've collected the data, you can just follow this
遵守計畫要點，處理收集的資料

8
00:00:27.834 --> 00:00:32.360
pre-registered plan to make sure that your type I error rate is nicely controlled.
讓型一錯誤率得到最佳控制

9
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.350
Let's talk a little bit about why this is important, and how you can pre-register
本講介紹預先註冊的重要性

10
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.910
and what you need to take care of when you make a pre-registration.
以及規劃預先註冊的建議

11
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.030
Let's first focus on the importance of pre-registration.
首先談預先註冊的重要性

12
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.077
Why do we need to do this?
為何我們需要這麼做？

13
00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:49.168
Now, this is an example where you don't really need to read the fine print here,
投影片裡的例子你不需要仔細閱讀

14
00:00:49.168 --> 00:00:50.446
I'll explain it to you.
讓我解釋給你聽

15
00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:55.330
This is the first study in an article by Daryl Bem about precognition.
這段文字來自Daryl Bem發表的超感知覺論文

16
00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.500
And in his experiment,
這篇論文的第一個研究

17
00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.076
he had 100 participants who performed a sort of reversed priming task.
招募100位參與者進行反向促發實驗

18
00:01:01.076 --> 00:01:06.020
Normally, people have to categorize stimuli by pressing one of two buttons,
一般的實驗是讓人在看過刺激之後

19
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.520
and this happens, of course, after they have seen the stimulus.
使用兩個反應按鍵分類刺激

20
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.910
But here this was reversed.
只是這個實驗反過來做

21
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.370
So people first made a choice, they pressed one or the other button.
他請人先按鍵再看刺激

22
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.460
And only then did they see the stimulus that they were supposed to respond to.
刺激出現後才知道有沒有按對

23
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.220
So if they could predict the future,
如果人可以預測未來

24
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.620
you would expect that they were right, more than guessing average.
反應正確率應該比純粹猜測還高

25
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.560
And in this case, we see that's there was a situation where a number of different
這一系列研究操弄了很多種類的刺激

26
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.130
types of stimuli were used.
這一系列研究操弄了很多種類的刺激

27
00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.540
The reported result here, the main result, is their performance on erotic stimuli.
投影片這段報告是情色類刺激的實驗結果

28
00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:38.750
But there are a lot of other,
論文中還有其他種類刺激的實驗報告
不過都沒有發現顯著差異

29
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.960
different types of stimuli that were used where no differences were found.
論文中還有其他種類刺激的實驗報告
不過都沒有發現顯著差異

30
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.517
So for example, although the performance was higher than chance on the erotic
情色類的反應表現有顯著高於純粹猜測

31
00:01:47.517 --> 00:01:52.159
stimuli, there were no differences on negative stimuli or romantic stimuli.
而負面訊息與浪漫類刺激都沒有發現差異

32
00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:55.457
Now if you see this, this sort of makes you wonder,
講到這裡，你也許會好奇

33
00:01:55.457 --> 00:02:00.156
is this really the main prediction that this researcher set out to test?
這樣的結果真的符合作者的預測嗎？

34
00:02:00.156 --> 00:02:04.292
If you look at the p-value, if you do the math and you have a Bonferroni correction,
看到報告裡的p值，回想前面提到的Bonferroni校正

35
00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:07.964
you want to control the type I error rate for all the possible combinations,
你會想到要控制所有種類的型一錯誤率

36
00:02:07.964 --> 00:02:10.996
then this would actually not be statistically significant if
如果全部種類的結果都考慮進來

37
00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:15.390
we would have controlled our error rate for all possible comparisons.
這段文字裡沒有一個p值低於統計顯著水準

38
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.035
So you see that it's very important to specify which test you are really
由此可知在進行分析前，
預先說明要做的檢定是很重要的

39
00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:23.165
interested in before you do the analysis,
to make sure that other people who read
可以讓讀者知道你的處理符合統計原則

40
00:02:23.165 --> 00:02:27.443
your article are also convinced that your results and your findings are credible.
讓報告的結果與發現更加可信

41
00:02:30.041 --> 00:02:35.357
Now, here we see that there's a wide range of options of how to analyze your data,
這張漫畫示意分析資料的操作有兩個極端

42
00:02:35.357 --> 00:02:39.980
ranging from very exploratory analysis, you just look at your data and
一邊是探索性分析，只是概覽資料

43
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.836
anything that happens to stand out you consider as an informative result,
任何分析產物都被當成有意義的結果

44
00:02:44.836 --> 00:02:48.430
to a situation where you slightly torture your data.
這個情況會有拷問資料的情況

45
00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.340
You don't really look at everything that's possible, but you have one hypothesis,
如果你有一個假設，就不會看所有分析產物是有意義的

46
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.890
but you look at it from this side or
這就要把目光移向另一端

47
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.740
from that side, to a situation where research is purely confirmatory.
了解驗證性分析的重點是

48
00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.344
You specify what you want to do, you perform the experiment and
預先表列待辦事項、照表執行實驗

49
00:03:02.344 --> 00:03:03.638
you analyze the data.
以及分析資料

50
00:03:03.638 --> 00:03:08.069
So this is from a research article by Wagenmakers and colleagues where they
以上所談就是來自這張插圖的原始出處

51
00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.519
argue for the necessity of having a purely confirmatory research agenda.
Wagenmakers與同儕發表說明驗證性研究綱領的論文

52
00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.490
We can see examples in the scientific literature for
還有個例子來自一篇之後的課程會談

53
00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.098
where this would make sense, for example, in a paper about p-curve analysis,
有關p-curve分析的論文

54
00:03:23.098 --> 00:03:25.830
a topic we'll come back to later.
說明註冊研究的重要性

55
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.160
Simonsohn and colleagues analyzed
a set of studies from the Journal
作者Simonsohn等人分析一系列
發表於人格與社會心理學論文的數據

56
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.790
of Personality and Social Psychology,
作者Simonsohn等人分析一系列
發表於人格與社會心理學論文的數據

57
00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.830
where the researchers reported
the results only with a covariate.
這些數據都有報告共變量分析

58
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.260
So you can do a covariate analysis, and
一般來說做共變量分析

59
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.340
it might really answer the question that you are asking.
是為了澄清無法直接從結果回答的一些問題

60
00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.900
But what we also know is that people are sometimes using a covariate
但是圈內人都知道有時共變量分析

61
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.150
as a flexible way to look at their data from a different perspective
會被用做降低主要效果p值的手段

62
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.810
with the goal to reduce the level of the p-value.
會被用做降低主要效果p值的手段

63
00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.870
So their initial analysis might not show a statistically significant effect, but
這些人做分析後發現主要效果並未統計顯著

64
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.200
then they play around with their data just a little bit until
就拿其他變項進來做共變量分析

65
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.635
adding a covariate would make a statistical analysis significant.
做到其中一個讓主要效果的統計值顯著

66
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.820
So when they look at a set of studies that use covariates, they see that the p-curve
所以Simonsohn挑出有做共變量分析的論文

67
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.880
analysis shows that these studies actually lack evidential value.
p-curve分析發現這些研究結果缺乏證據價值

68
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.563
So using this flexibility leads to a a set of studies in the scientific literature
由此可見研究者的操作彈性已讓部分科學文獻

69
00:04:18.563 --> 00:04:21.719
that really don't tell us anything about what's likely to be true.
充斥不具實質證據的研究結果

70
00:04:24.307 --> 00:04:28.252
So recently, people in psychology have been starting to think about how can we
現在心理學研究者開始思考
如何改善研究操作彈性帶來的問題

71
00:04:28.252 --> 00:04:30.070
change this type of flexibility?
現在心理學研究者開始思考
如何改善研究操作彈性帶來的問題

72
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.590
How can we make sure that people actually report the analysis that they
如何確認研究者報告的分析是從一開始就設計好的？

73
00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.970
set out to do in the beginning?
如何確認研究者報告的分析是從一開始就設計好的？

74
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.920
And an increasingly popular solution is the use of registered reports,
註冊報告是正在興起的模式

75
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:44.690
where people write down their predictions before they perform the data collection.
報告作者要在開始收集資料前寫出報告

76
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.760
And then they analyze their data just by following these reports.
接著要按照報告分析資料

77
00:04:48.852 --> 00:04:52.410
Now, it's very important that this specifies the plan of the analysis of
報告的重點是陳列驗證主要假設的
所有分析計畫細節

78
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.050
the main hypothesis.
報告的重點是陳列驗證主要假設的
所有分析計畫細節

79
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.320
Of course, it doesn't prevent you from exploring your data.
當然，報告作者還是可做探索性分析

80
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.431
This is perfectly fine, but it just differentiates between pre-registered,
這種模式是介於預先註冊的驗證性研究
與探索性研究之間

81
00:05:01.431 --> 00:05:04.360
confirmatory research and more exploratory research.
這種模式是介於預先註冊的驗證性研究
與探索性研究之間

82
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.150
So in this way pre-registration formalizes the Type 1 error control.
預先註冊有型一錯誤的控制標準措施

83
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.610
You have a very specific plan that you set out to do, and all the tests that you do
一開始要設定詳盡的分析計畫

84
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:20.290
that follow your pre-registered hypothesis have a controlled Type 1 error rate.
並按照預先設定的控制條件進行所有檢定

85
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.740
For other analysis, more exploratory analysis,
至於偏向探索性的分析

86
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.220
you can test anything that you'd like.
研究者可以按需要執行

87
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.800
But in this case, your error rate is inflated to an unknown level, so
但是要自負型一錯誤率膨脹的風險

88
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.030
you don't really know the probability that you're making a false positive result.
沒有人告訴你結果是偽陽性的機率有多高

89
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.450
Does this matter?
這麼做值得嗎？

90
00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:41.300
Aren't we making life a lot more complicated by asking researchers to
有沒有研究者覺得預先註冊會增加工作負擔？

91
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.780
pre- register their hypothesis?
有沒有研究者覺得預先註冊會增加工作負擔？

92
00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.280
Well, there's some data to show that there is indeed a benefit of pre-registering and
現在已有資料證實預先註冊的好處

93
00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:50.530
preventing this flexibility.
可以降低操作彈性的問題

94
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:55.490
This is from an analysis of a set of studies that were large,
這張圖來自醫藥領域的大數據分析

95
00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.480
randomized, controlled trials in medicine, either before it was
這個領域有執行隨機化臨床試驗前要在網站預先註冊的政策

96
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.620
formally required to pre-register your study, the design and
圖中左右兩側的點顯示政策上路前與上路後的研究品質

97
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.000
the analysis plan in clinical trials.gov, and after this was formally required.
圖中左右兩側的點顯示政策上路前與上路後的研究品質

98
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.930
So on the left, we see that from all the big, randomized control trials,
圖左側是上路前的臨床試驗結果

99
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.640
some don't show any statistically significant result, but many actually do.
雖然其中有不少並沒有達到統計顯著

100
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:24.050
17 out of 30 studies before 2000 actually show a significant result.
但是30項裡總共有17項報告統計顯著結果

101
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:31.880
After pre-registration became required, this percentage drops to only 2 out of 25.
政策上路後25項研究只有2項有統計顯著結果

102
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.550
Now, this is an indication that if we
ask people to specify their hypothesis
這項資料告訴我們只要研究者預先註冊

103
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.950
beforehand, they don't always succeed in confirming their hypothesis,
並不會總是成功地驗證假設

104
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.430
which is totally fine, of course.
總體而言這是好的發展

105
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:46.480
It's very important to realize that
your prediction did not hold up.
了解不是每個預測都能被支持是很重要的

106
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.973
There might have been new insights and exploratory analyses in the studies done
這項資料能讓我們透視西元2000年後的發展

107
00:06:50.973 --> 00:06:55.008
after 2000, but these need to confirmed in follow-up research.
不過更多利弊還需要更進一步的確認

108
00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:01.694
So we see that the main goal of pre-registration is distinguishing
談到現在你已知道預先註冊的重點是

109
00:07:01.694 --> 00:07:05.800
confirmatory research from exploratory research.
區分驗證性研究與探索性研究

110
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.520
This is sometimes called HARKing, hypothesizing after the results are known.
後者有時稱為"事後諸葛"(HARKing)

111
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.964
If we think back to the study we described in the beginning about precognition,
拿一開始提的超感知覺研究來說

112
00:07:15.964 --> 00:07:20.011
where a researcher tests all sorts of hypotheses, then after looking at
研究者測試所有可行的假設

113
00:07:20.011 --> 00:07:24.917
the data, a researcher might think, of course, there' s something very special
看過資料後也許想到能解釋情色類刺激有差異

114
00:07:24.917 --> 00:07:29.805
about erotic stimuli that's not present in negative stimuli or in romantic stimuli.
但負向訊息或浪漫類無差異的絕佳說法

115
00:07:29.805 --> 00:07:33.429
And this researcher might come up with a hypothesis of why it's actually very
論文作者能把這樣的說法寫成能在實驗前做出預測

116
00:07:33.429 --> 00:07:36.090
plausible that an effect has occurred.
論文作者能把這樣的說法寫成能在實驗前做出預測

117
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.470
But this is hypothesizing　after the results are known.
實際是分析結果之後才提出假設

118
00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.740
This is creating a hypothesis　based on the observed data, and
這種假設是有了資料才被創造出來

119
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.320
that's reversing the empirical cycle.
與科學研究的流程完全相反

120
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.520
When you're exploring data,　you can perform a hypothesis test, but
探索性研究可以展現可行的假設

121
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.950
you can't test a hypothesis.
但不能測試假設

122
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.710
This is a statement by De Groot,　who already pointed this out in the 1950s.
這是荷蘭心理學家De Groot在1950年代提出的主張

123
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.190
The point here is that it's perfectly fine to explore data and
探索資料中任何可能引出有趣想法的訊息是好的

124
00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.360
look around, patterns that you might find.
探索資料中任何可能引出有趣想法的訊息是好的

125
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.290
But when you do this, you cannot test whether this hypothesis is actually true
但是若你在事前還沒想到這樣的假設

126
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.390
because what you have done, you have actually
不能用啟發想法的資料

127
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:16.429
tested a hypothesis on the same data set that was used to generate it.
測試事後才形成的假設

128
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:22.400
The alpha level in this case is unknown, it has inflated to an unknown extent.
"事後諸葛"導致型一錯誤膨脹的程度還未可估算

129
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.229
So you can never be sure whether this is a type I error or not.
沒人知道這類文獻的型一錯誤率有多少

130
00:08:25.229 --> 00:08:29.593
And you can make no statement about the frequency of Type I errors in the long
也無法得知這類研究操作的長遠影響

131
00:08:29.593 --> 00:08:32.720
run, if you are allowing yourself to be so flexible.
累積的文獻品質是好是壞

132
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.670
So when you pre-register your study, what are things that you need to specify?
要提出一項預先註冊研究，有什麼要注意的呢？

133
00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:40.700
Well, as we've seen,
前一講已學到

134
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.990
optional stopping is one way in which you can inflate your Type I error rate.
中停分析是最可能膨脹型一錯誤率的因素

135
00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:48.670
So one thing that you have to do is justify your sample size.
針對這點能做的是明確宣告要收集的樣本數

136
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.280
Of course, thinking about your sample size before you collect
當然事前宣告樣本數也能有效控制型二錯誤率

137
00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.840
data is also very useful in controlling your type II error rate.
當然事前宣告樣本數也能有效控制型二錯誤率

138
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.650
Thinking about how many people you need will control both these error rates, but
想清楚要招募多少人能控制兩種錯誤

139
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.980
it will fix the type I error rate to whatever level you've specified.
更能將型一錯誤率固定在設定好的水準

140
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.390
This is sometimes known as the stopping rule.
有時也會遇上必須的中停情況

141
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.960
It can be anything, you can collect data until it starts to rain outside or
像是要在下雨天才能收集資料

142
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.190
until the week is over, anything that you want.
要隔一個星期才能找回受試者等等

143
00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.512
In a later lecture, we'll talk about justifying your sample sizes.
之後有一講會談界定樣本數的做法

144
00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:22.611
Another thing you need to specify is the independent variable and
第二點是事先明列統計檢定中的獨變項與依變項

145
00:09:22.611 --> 00:09:26.230
the dependent variable for each test that you want to do.
第二點是事先明列統計檢定中的獨變項與依變項

146
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.880
What is it that you're actually going to analyze?
那些變項是要放進分析程序的？

147
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.780
What are the conditions in your study?
那些變項是標記實驗條件？

148
00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:34.310
And what are the dependent variables with which you measure whatever type of
那些依變項的數值是根據預測所做的測量？

149
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.120
effect you predict?
那些依變項的數值是根據預測所做的測量？

150
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.035
For the dependent variable, it might be relevant to say,
依變項的說明清單可以報告

151
00:09:39.035 --> 00:09:42.617
I'm using a questionnaire and these are the items that I will average.
使用的問題選項以及要計算平均的題目

152
00:09:42.617 --> 00:09:46.168
And I will perform my analysis on this average score.
如何處理平均得分的方式等等

153
00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:50.375
It matters whether you do this, or maybe use one of all these items.
這些說明有關要不要做、該不該全做等彈性

154
00:09:50.375 --> 00:09:54.528
So this flexibility should be prevented by specifying what the DV is.
明確說明依變項的處置能避免這類彈性操作

155
00:09:56.723 --> 00:09:59.030
Finally, you should describe your analysis plan.
最後，清楚描述分析計畫

156
00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.308
How are you going to analyze your data, and
你要如何分析資料

157
00:10:02.308 --> 00:10:04.851
which statistical tests do you plan to perform?
要使用什麼統計檢定

158
00:10:04.851 --> 00:10:08.638
This includes specifying things like the alpha level that you want to use for
包括顯著水準的設定都要交待

159
00:10:08.638 --> 00:10:09.248
each test.
包括顯著水準的設定都要交待

160
00:10:09.248 --> 00:10:12.199
How are you going to correct for multiple comparisons, or
像是如何校正多重比較

161
00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:16.300
do you want to use a 5% error rate or a 1% error rate or a 10% error rate?
型一錯誤率設定是5%,1%或10%

162
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:18.540
What do you think is sensible?
解釋為何如此設定是夠靈敏的

163
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.670
It also requires you to specify things like data cleaning.
其他要交待的有如何清理原始資料

164
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:23.230
What is an outlier, and
如何標記極端值

165
00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:26.080
how you're going to remove outliers when they're problematic.
以及移除極端值是基於什麼品質條件

166
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:32.463
Now, we see that journals are increasingly starting to use these pre-registered
越來越多期刊開始接受預先註冊

167
00:10:32.463 --> 00:10:33.015
studies.
越來越多期刊開始接受預先註冊

168
00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:36.869
In this example, journal Perspectives on Psychological Science is using
以「心理科學觀點」為例

169
00:10:36.869 --> 00:10:40.847
pre-registered protocols to perform large-scale replication studies,
這本期刊接受大型再現研究的預先註冊

170
00:10:40.847 --> 00:10:44.639
where a lot of people team up and perform a pre-registered replication of
這是號召多人合作，進行主題文獻的註冊再現研究

171
00:10:44.639 --> 00:10:47.230
an existing study in the scientific literature.
這是號召多人合作，進行主題文獻的註冊再現研究

172
00:10:49.984 --> 00:10:54.735
There's a clear benefit of pre-registering your studies, especially when the journal
預先註冊有顯而易見的好處

173
00:10:54.735 --> 00:10:59.320
where you're going to submit your research allows for these pre-registered reports.
特別是有期刊接受你提出預先註冊報告

174
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.250
So you can do this for a replication study, but
不只可以做再現研究

175
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.770
you can also do it for very novel research.
也可以做原創研究

176
00:11:03.770 --> 00:11:08.150
This means that based on the plan that you have, you'll get comments from
這樣的好處是提出計畫之後

177
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:13.160
experts in the field that tell you how to improve your study design before you have
你能收到同行專家給予改善設計的建議

178
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.570
put in all the effort to collect the data, analyze the data, and write the report.
接著再收集資料，分析結果與撰寫報告

179
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.130
Compared to the traditional system, where you only get all this feedback and
有別於傳統投稿模式，同行回饋是

180
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:25.170
these comments after you already did all the work.
完成全部工作之後才會收到

181
00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:29.200
There's a big benefit because these peer reviews before you collect the data will
如此的好處是你在收集資料之前

182
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.050
allow you to improve your study design.
就能根據同行建議改善設計

183
00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.590
So instead of doing all the hard work, and then being told by reviewers that you made
而非好不容易完成研究之後
你才收到負評滿滿的同儕評審

184
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:41.100
a mistake or you should have taken into account something that you didn't see,
而非好不容易完成研究之後
你才收到負評滿滿的同儕評審

185
00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.920
you can get this feedback before you collect the data.
預先註冊讓你收集資料前就知道問題

186
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:48.657
So this is a very efficient way to make sure that you perform a well-designed
這能有效地研究者獲得同儕審查的認可之後

187
00:11:48.657 --> 00:11:52.653
study, where your peer reviewers agree that this is, indeed,
執行良好設計的研究

188
00:11:52.653 --> 00:11:55.479
the best approach to study a specific topic.
這種模式對特定主題的研究特別有利

189
00:11:55.479 --> 00:11:57.764
And that the results will be informative,
結果不論有沒有統計顯著
也是有益科學發展的資訊

190
00:11:57.764 --> 00:12:02.180
regardless of whether they
are statistically significant or not.
結果不論有沒有統計顯著
也是有益科學發展的資訊

191
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:06.560
And this is another very important benefit of these registered reports.
這是註冊報告的另一個好處

192
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.123
When you've submitted your study design for publication, the peer reviewers
透過發表研究設計

193
00:12:10.123 --> 00:12:14.580
give you some suggestions to improve the way that you want to study this topic.
同行評審給予改善設計的建議

194
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:20.790
The editor of the journal will say as long as you follow this pre-registered design,
期刊主編可向投稿註冊報告的作者宣言

195
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.340
regardless of the outcome of the study, we will publish it.
只要如實按表操作，不管結果如何，必定完整發表

196
00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.085
Now, we know that publication bias is a huge problem in the scientific literature.
出版偏誤充斥科學文獻是不可忽視的問題

197
00:12:28.085 --> 00:12:32.696
There are way more study results that turn out to be statistically significant,
主觀預期經由很多方式引導發表的研究結果

198
00:12:32.696 --> 00:12:34.300
as you would expect.
主觀預期經由很多方式引導發表的研究結果

199
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.290
The reason for this is that people don't publish their non-significant findings or,
導致出版偏誤的主因是很多人不想發表不顯著的結果

200
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.500
when they are submitted for publication, journals don't accept them.
尤其是很多期刊會拒絕不顯著的結果

201
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:47.295
Now, this problem is prevented by these registered reports because people say if
註冊報告能避免這樣的問題

202
00:12:47.295 --> 00:12:51.689
you follow this plan, we will publish the results no matter what the outcome.
只要按計畫操作，不管是什麼樣的結果，期刊都會刊出

203
00:12:51.689 --> 00:12:54.963
So this is an important benefit, and if you do a challenging study,
對於挑戰前人的研究，這更是一項優勢

204
00:12:54.963 --> 00:12:58.764
it's very worthwhile to consider following these registered report rules.
值得我們考慮採取註冊研究規範的好處

205
00:13:01.257 --> 00:13:05.100
There's some other benefits to pre-registering your studies.
預先註冊還有一些值得一提的好處

206
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:09.430
For example, you can do less conventional, but more efficient, designs.
像是有些作法不保守、卻更有效率的研究設計

207
00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.610
We already discussed how you can improve
前一講提到採用單側檢定能提高檢定力

208
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:18.540
the statistical power of your test by performing a one-sided test.
前一講提到採用單側檢定能提高檢定力

209
00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:20.750
This also controls the error rate.
這辦法也能控制型一錯誤率

210
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.300
But you're saying that you have a directional prediction.
不過這辦法用在有方向性預測才好

211
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.380
And if this is the case,
如果條件許可

212
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.980
then you can be more efficient in designing a well-powered study.
就能在有高考驗力的研究裡發揮作用

213
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.892
However, people always think that there's something wrong with people who report
只是許多人仍存有成見，
覺得這辦法是用來降低p值的技倆

214
00:13:33.892 --> 00:13:38.149
one-sided tests because it's very often used as a way to reduce the p-value.
只是許多人仍存有成見，
覺得這辦法是用來降低p值的技倆

215
00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.790
So in this pre-registered report, you can write down that you have a directional
不過你可以在在註冊報告裡寫清楚方向性假設

216
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:45.700
prediction, you'll do a one-sided test, and
說明單側檢定的必要性

217
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:49.340
you can reap the benefits of this directional hypothesis.
就可以用清晰的假設對抗成見

218
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.310
Now, there's some places where you can pre-register your study design.
你可運用現成的網路平台佈置預先註冊

219
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:59.560
You can visit the Open Science Framework, or websites such as AsPredicted.org.
像是Open Science Framework
或AsPredicted.org

220
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.050
You can see what's required for
根據你的實際需要

221
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:05.440
you to pre-register your study, which information you need to fill out.
選擇合適的平台預先註冊你的研究

222
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.870
Now, if you do this, you can keep this pre-registration private so
這些平台可以設定不公開預先註冊內容

223
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:14.040
you don't need to publish it online so that everybody can see what you do.
有需要的話，不必一開始就在網路上完全公開

224
00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.070
It is possible, but you can just keep it private until the moment
你可以設定不公開期限

225
00:14:17.070 --> 00:14:20.000
that you're going to submit your results for publication.
直到正式向期刊投稿為止

226
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.640
And you can say, look, these are the results that I'm presenting, and
你可以昭告天下，剛完成的研究結果

227
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:28.220
you can see that this is exactly what I predicted when I designed the study.
是完全符合最初設計時的預測

228
00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:29.328
So in this lecture,
簡單總結

229
00:14:29.328 --> 00:14:32.982
we've seen that pre-registration is a novel, but very useful,
預先註冊是一種新穎的研究模式

230
00:14:32.982 --> 00:14:37.302
solution to distinguish exploratory research from confirmatory research.
但是能區分探索性與驗證性的研究操作

231
00:14:37.302 --> 00:14:38.311
And in doing so,
按規範操作的話

232
00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:41.998
it allows you to adequately control your type I error rates.
能控制型一錯誤率在合理範圍之內

233
00:14:41.998 --> 00:14:42.498
